**OpenClaw-RL** (Princeton, Gen-Verse, 2026) — fully asynchronous RL framework that turns conversations into training signals for self-hosted AI agents.

**Key facts:**

- Every reply, tool output, terminal result, GUI state change → reward signal (no manual labeling)
- Personal agent improved 0.17 → 0.81 after 36 conversations
- Four async loops: agent serving, rollout collection, PRM/judge evaluation, policy training (PPO/GRPO)
- Three optimization methods: Binary RL, Hindsight OPD (token-level corrective guidance), Combined (recommended)
- Models deploy as OpenAI-compatible APIs (`http://<HOST_IP>:30000/v1`)
- Supports: Qwen 3.5-4B/8B via LoRA (local GPU), Tinker (serverless cloud)

**Connection to model-tier-strategy.md:** This is the concrete implementation of Tier 0 self-improvement. Referenced in the updated "Local Model Tier (Tier 0)" section.
