description: gstack browse CLI binary installed at ~/.local/bin/browse — zero-MCP-overhead headless Chromium for browser automation across 10 skills
type: tech
---

**gstack `browse` CLI** (MIT, from garrytan/gstack) installed at `~/.local/lib/browse/` with symlink at `~/.local/bin/browse`.

Built from source with Bun + Playwright. Architecture: thin CLI client → persistent daemon on localhost (auto-starts on first call, auto-stops after 30min idle). State in `.gstack/browse.json` per project.

**Why:** Zero MCP token overhead (plain stdout) vs 1500-2000 tokens per Chrome DevTools MCP call. ~100ms per call after cold start (~3s first call).

**Key features:**

- `snapshot -i` — interactive refs (@e1, @e2...)
- `snapshot -D` — diff vs previous snapshot (before/after verification)
- `snapshot -a -o path.png` — annotated screenshot with ref labels
- `snapshot -C` — cursor-interactive (finds non-ARIA clickable elements)
- `cookie-import-browser [browser]` — import cookies from Chrome/Arc/Brave/Edge via macOS Keychain
- `console` / `network` — ring buffer captures (50K capacity)
- `BROWSE_STATE_FILE` env var for multi-instance isolation (parallel testers)

**Integrated into 10 skills** (2026-03-14): fulltest-skill, qa-cycle, qa-sourcerank, virtual-user-testing, qa-verify, growth, qa-conta, qa-stonegeo, chief-geo, pinchtab. All use browse as primary, Chrome DevTools MCP as fallback. Detection: `test -x ~/.local/bin/browse`.

**Dependencies:** bun (homebrew), Playwright Chromium (bundled). `~/.local/bin` added to PATH in `~/.zshrc`.

**Build from source:** `cd /tmp && git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git && cd gstack && bun install && bun run build`

**Headed mode (launched 2026-04-04):** `/open-gstack-browser` (after `/gstack-upgrade`) opens a real steerable Chromium with a sidebar running an interactive Claude Code session. Connected to both the sidebar AND the origin Claude Code instance. Use for live CSS debugging and visual inspection when headless screenshots aren't enough to diagnose failures.
