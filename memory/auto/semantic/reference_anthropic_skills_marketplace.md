description: Official Anthropic skills repo registered as plugin marketplace; eval pipeline patterns adopted into skill authoring rules

Anthropic's official skills repo is registered as a Claude Code plugin marketplace under the key `anthropic-agent-skills` in `~/.claude/settings.json` → `extraKnownMarketplaces` (repo: `anthropics/skills`).

Install reference skills via `/plugin install <name>@anthropic-agent-skills`. Available: `algorithmic-art`, `brand-guidelines`, `canvas-design`, `claude-api`, `doc-coauthoring`, `docx`, `frontend-design`, `internal-comms`, `mcp-builder`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `skill-creator`, `slack-gif-creator`, `theme-factory`, `web-artifacts-builder`, `webapp-testing`, `xlsx`.

The `skill-creator` skill ships an eval pipeline (`scripts/aggregate_benchmark`, `eval-viewer/generate_review.py`, `scripts/run_loop`) and a description-optimization workflow that splits queries 60/40 train/test and iterates up to 5 times, picking the winner by test score to avoid overfitting. These patterns now live in `~/.claude-setup/rules/skill-authoring-conventions.md` under "Eval Pipeline" and "Description Optimization".

Key principles imported into the rules file:
- Descriptions should be **pushy** — Claude undertriggers skills by default; the description is the only routing signal in context
- All "when to use" goes in the description, not the body
- Body targets <500 lines; split overflow into `references/` with explicit pointers
- Prefer "explain why" over `MUST`/`NEVER`/`ALWAYS` — modern Claude has theory of mind
- Evals live in a sibling `<skill>-workspace/` directory with `iteration-N/` subdirs

**Why:** Anthropic's reference implementations are production-validated (they power Claude's built-in docx/pdf/xlsx/pptx capabilities). Aligning your authoring conventions to the official spec means skill quality rises without reinventing patterns.

**How to apply:** When creating or promoting a skill to Active, follow the eval loop in `skill-authoring-conventions.md`. When auditing descriptions for trigger accuracy, install `skill-creator` from the marketplace and run its `scripts/run_loop`.
