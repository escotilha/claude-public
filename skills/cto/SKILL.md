# CTO - Universal AI Technical Advisor

A comprehensive CTO advisor skill that provides strategic technical leadership for any project. Analyzes codebases, evaluates architecture, recommends improvements, and guides technical decisions.

## Auto-Memory Note

Auto-memory (v2.1.59) captures session context automatically. When saving findings to Memory MCP, focus on **structured architectural decisions and cross-concern insights** — not raw session data that auto-memory already handles. Only create Memory MCP entities for insights with relevance score >= 5 (per memory-consolidation skill).

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Architecture Review

- Evaluate system design and component relationships
- Identify architectural anti-patterns
- Recommend improvements for scalability and maintainability
- Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Use multi-perspective investigation for major decisions:
  - Primary analysis (direct codebase evidence)
  - Literature review (established patterns and best practices via WebSearch)
  - Expert consensus (what domain experts recommend)
  - Contrarian view (what could go wrong, who disagrees and why)

### 2. Code Quality Assessment

- Review code organization and structure
- Identify technical debt and code smells
- Recommend refactoring strategies
- Evaluate testing coverage and strategy

### 3. Security Audit

- Review for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Check authentication and authorization patterns
- Evaluate secrets management
- Assess input validation and output encoding
- **Agent Chassis Security** (for AI-integrated codebases): verify secrets are injected at the deterministic runtime layer, not passed through the AI context window; confirm a trust boundary exists around model calls; check that all outbound agent actions and secret accesses are audit-logged
- For production-wide or open-source vulnerability scanning, consider routing to **Claude Code Security** (AI-assisted SAST that reasons about code context rather than pattern-matching). Available for Enterprise/Team customers — especially effective for auth flows, RLS policies, and subtle context-dependent vulns that semgrep/trivy miss.

### 4. Performance Analysis

- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Review database query patterns
- Evaluate caching strategies
- Recommend optimization opportunities

### 5. Tech Stack Evaluation

- Assess current technology choices
- Recommend alternatives when appropriate
- Evaluate dependency health and security
- Plan migration strategies

### Swarm Specialist Agents

| Agent                    | Focus                     | Checks For                                                              | Priority |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **architecture-analyst** | System design             | Patterns, coupling, scalability, separation of concerns                 | Medium   |
| **security-analyst**     | Vulnerabilities + deps    | OWASP Top 10, secrets, auth/authz, injection, dependency CVEs, licenses | High     |
| **performance-analyst**  | Bottlenecks               | N+1 queries, caching, memory, complexity, bundle size                   | Medium   |
| **quality-analyst**      | Code health + conventions | Tech debt, testing, conventions, maintainability, framework currency    | Low      |

> **Note:** Stack-analyst responsibilities are merged into security-analyst (dependency CVEs, security advisories) and quality-analyst (version currency, deprecated packages, migration paths). This keeps the swarm at 4 teammates — the cost-effective sweet spot per AGENT-TEAMS-STRATEGY.md.

## Entry Point Detection

When this skill activates, determine the context:

| Condition                         | Action                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `cto-requirements.md` exists      | Load requirements and focus review    |
| No config, fulltest reports exist | Read reports first for context        |
| No config, no reports             | Full codebase exploration             |
| Specific question asked           | Answer directly with codebase context |

**First Action:** Check for existing context:

```bash
ls -la cto-requirements.md fulltest-report*.md AGENTS.md .claude/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Context

**Check for CTO requirements file:**

```bash
cat cto-requirements.md 2>/dev/null
```

If exists, this file defines:

- Focus areas (architecture, security, performance, etc.)
- Constraints and priorities
- Known issues to address
- Scope limitations

**Check for existing test reports:**

```bash
cat fulltest-report*.md 2>/dev/null | head -200
```

Test reports provide:

- Known bugs and issues
- Console errors
- Failed tests
- Broken links

**Check for AGENTS.md patterns:**

```bash
cat AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

Repository patterns inform:

- Existing conventions
- Previous architectural decisions
- Code organization

**Search memory for past findings (mem-search):**

Before spawning analysts, query persistent memory for relevant prior knowledge so analysts don't re-discover known issues:

```bash
# Architecture decisions from past reviews
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "architecture decisions"

# Known security vulnerabilities and patterns
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "security vulnerabilities"

# Project-specific findings (if project name is known)
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "<project name>"
```

Include any relevant results (architecture decisions, known vulnerabilities, past recommendations) in the context passed to analyst subagents. This avoids redundant discovery and lets analysts focus on new or changed areas.

### Directive Language

When prompting subagents or analyzing code, use thorough directive language:

- "Analyze **deeply** — understand all intricacies of how this system works"
- "Read **in great detail** — trace every data flow and edge case"
- "Investigate the **full dependency chain**, not just the immediate callers"

**Anti-patterns to enforce during review:**

- Flag unnecessary comments and jsdocs that add no value
- Flag `any` or `unknown` types in TypeScript — require explicit types
- Flag disabled linter rules without justification
- Recommend running `tsc --noEmit` continuously during implementation

### Step 2: Codebase Discovery

> **Long-Context Option:** For small-to-medium codebases (<500K tokens), a 1M-context model (e.g., Nvidia Nemotron 3 Super 120B via OpenRouter/NIM — 120B params, 12B active MoE, Mamba-2 SSM for linear-time 1M context at 478 tok/s) can load the entire codebase in one shot, eliminating the explore-agent phase entirely. When such a model is available and the project fits, skip discovery and pass full source to analysts directly. This collapses the explore + analyze steps into a single call.

> **Context Compression:** When `mcp__context-mode__*` tools are available, use `fetch_and_index` for large files (package-lock.json, directory trees, config dumps) and `search` for targeted queries instead of reading full files into context. Use `batch_execute` to combine typecheck + lint + test runs into a single call with intent filtering ("show only errors").

#### 2.0: QMD Context Pre-Computation (if project is indexed)

Before exploring the codebase manually, check if QMD has the project indexed. If so, use it to pre-compute file lists per analyst domain — this avoids each analyst independently discovering the same directory structure.

```bash
# Check if the project has a QMD collection
qmd collection list 2>/dev/null | grep -i "$(basename $(pwd))"
```

If the project is indexed in QMD, run targeted queries to pre-compute context for the swarm:

```bash
# Security-relevant files
qmd search "auth middleware jwt token session password" -c <collection> --files -n 20

# Performance-relevant files
qmd search "database query ORM prisma cache connection pool" -c <collection> --files -n 20

# Architecture-relevant files
qmd search "routes API components layout services" -c <collection> --files -n 20

# Quality-relevant files
qmd search "test spec coverage lint config CI" -c <collection> --files -n 20
```

Store the results as pre-computed file lists to include in each analyst's spawn prompt. This implements the "Avoid Re-Reading" pattern from AGENT-TEAMS-STRATEGY.md — each analyst gets exact file paths instead of spending tokens on `find` and `grep` during discovery.

**If QMD is not available or project is not indexed**, fall back to the standard discovery below.

#### 2.0b: Skill Tree Pre-Split (for large codebases)

If the project has >100 source files across multiple domains, consider pre-splitting the codebase into a skill tree before spawning analysts. This gives each analyst a focused file list instead of exploring the full tree:

```bash
# Check if a skill tree already exists for this project
ls .skill-trees/codebase/_index.md 2>/dev/null
```

If no tree exists and the codebase is large, the orchestrator can invoke `/skill-tree` to create one. Then include in each analyst's spawn prompt:

```
Read .skill-trees/codebase/_index.md for project overview.
Your domain files: {files from the relevant section}
Skip all other sections — other analysts cover those.
```

This implements the "Avoid Re-Reading" pattern more aggressively — each analyst gets pre-routed to their exact slice of the codebase, spending zero tokens on discovery.

**Detect tech stack:**

```bash
# Package files
ls package.json requirements.txt go.mod Cargo.toml pyproject.toml composer.json Gemfile 2>/dev/null

# Read main package file
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | head -50
cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**Analyze project structure:**

```bash
# Directory structure
find . -type d -maxdepth 3 ! -path '*/node_modules/*' ! -path '*/.git/*' ! -path '*/dist/*' ! -path '*/__pycache__/*' 2>/dev/null | head -50

# Key configuration files
ls -la tsconfig.json .eslintrc* .prettierrc* jest.config* vitest.config* playwright.config* 2>/dev/null
```

**Identify patterns:**

```
1. Framework: Next.js, React, Vue, Express, FastAPI, etc.
2. Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Supabase, etc.
3. Testing: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Pytest, etc.
4. Deployment: Vercel, Railway, Docker, etc.
5. State management: Redux, Zustand, Pinia, etc.
```

### Step 3: Swarm Mode Analysis (Recommended for Full Reviews)

> **Remote Monitoring:** Before spawning the swarm, remind the user: _"To monitor this session from another device, run `/remote-control` or `/rc`."_ Swarm analysis runs for several minutes — Remote Control lets you approve/review from phone or browser while analysts work.

When performing a comprehensive review, spawn parallel specialist analysts using TeammateTool:

#### 3.1: Spawn Specialist Swarm

**Mode selection:**

```
IF TeamCreate is available AND review scope covers 2+ areas:
  → Agent Teams mode (preferred — real-time cross-concern detection)
ELSE:
  → Task mode (fallback — spawn via Task tool with run_in_background)
```

**Agent Teams mode — spawn 4 teammates:**

Pre-compute codebase context before spawning to avoid each analyst re-discovering the same information:

```
Pre-computed context to include in each spawn prompt:
- Tech stack: {framework}, {database}, {test runner}, {deployment}
- Key directories: {src_dirs}, {test_dirs}, {config_files}
- Known issues from fulltest reports (if any)
```

**Context engineering for analyst prompts:**

- **Lost-in-the-middle mitigation:** Place the analyst's checklist and file ownership at the START and END of each prompt. Put project context (tech stack, directories) in the middle.
- **Context compression:** Instruct analysts to read only relevant sections of large files (use offset/limit). Never read full files over 500 lines — read the function/class they need.
- **Scope boundaries:** Each analyst has FILE OWNERSHIP (below). Do not read or analyze files outside your ownership. This prevents N analysts from reading the same files, wasting N context windows.
- **Early termination:** If an analyst finds 0 issues in their first 10 files, they should message the lead immediately rather than exhaustively scanning every file. Code with no issues doesn't need a full audit.

Spawn each analyst with these constraints:

```
Teammate "architecture-analyst":
  Review {src_dirs} for architecture patterns, coupling, scalability.
  FILE OWNERSHIP: You own analysis of {src_dirs structure}. Do NOT read or analyze
  files in {auth_dirs} or {test_dirs} — those belong to security and quality analysts.
  Checklist: component boundaries, dependency graph, API layer design, data flow,
  circular dependencies, separation of concerns, scalability readiness.
  Report: severity | file:line | issue | recommendation
  Message the lead with critical findings immediately.
  Message security-analyst directly ONLY if you find auth design flaws.
  Message performance-analyst directly ONLY if you find potential query patterns.
  Do NOT broadcast. When done, message the lead with your summary.

Teammate "security-analyst":
  Review {auth_files} and {api_files} for vulnerabilities. Also run `npm audit` / `pip-audit`.
  FILE OWNERSHIP: You own {auth_dirs}, {api_dirs}, package.json/lock files.

  Checklist — use Trail of Bits–style specificity, not generic OWASP surface scanning:

  AUTH & AUTHORIZATION
  - Auth flow: trace every code path that grants access. Check for auth bypass via
    parameter pollution, HTTP verb tampering, or path traversal above auth middleware.
  - RBAC/ABAC: verify roles are checked server-side on every privileged route, not
    just derived from JWT claims without re-validation against the DB.
  - Mass assignment: grep for `req.body` spread into DB update/create calls (e.g.,
    `Object.assign(record, req.body)`, Prisma `data: req.body`, Mongoose `Model.create(req.body)`).
    Any unfiltered user input mapped to ORM fields is a candidate for privilege escalation.
  - Insecure direct object reference (IDOR): check if resource IDs are validated
    against the authenticated user's ownership/scope before access.

  INJECTION & INPUT HANDLING
  - SQL injection: grep for raw string interpolation into queries (`query(\`...${var}\``).
  - Header injection: grep for user-controlled values written directly into HTTP response
    headers (`res.setHeader`, `res.set`) without sanitization — enables CRLF injection.
  - Log injection: user input written to logs without stripping newlines enables
    log forging (`\n`, `\r` in logged request parameters).
  - Path traversal: `path.join` or `fs.readFile` calls receiving user input without
    normalization + allowlist validation.

  TIMING & CRYPTOGRAPHY
  - Timing attacks: grep for direct string equality on secrets, tokens, or password
    hashes (`===`, `==`, `.equals()`) — must use constant-time comparison
    (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`, `hmac` comparison). Flag every occurrence.
  - Constant-time analysis: check HMAC/signature verification code paths for
    early-exit comparisons that leak secret length via timing.
  - Weak primitives: `MD5`, `SHA1` for passwords or HMAC; `Math.random()` for
    token generation; `DES`, `RC4` encryption.
  - JWT: verify `alg: none` is rejected; RS256 algorithm confusion (accepting HS256
    with public key as HMAC secret); missing `exp` / `aud` / `iss` validation.

  API SECURITY
  - Rate limiting: confirm auth endpoints (login, password reset, OTP) have rate
    limiting applied at the route level, not just globally.
  - Mass assignment (API layer): OpenAPI/Zod/Joi schemas — verify output schemas
    strip internal fields (`passwordHash`, `isAdmin`, `stripeCustomerId`) so they
    are never serialized into API responses.
  - SSRF: any server-side URL fetch driven by user input (`fetch(req.body.url)`,
    `axios.get(req.query.webhook)`) — check for allowlist validation and blocked
    private IP ranges (169.254.x.x, 10.x, 127.x).
  - HTTP security headers: check for `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
    `X-Frame-Options` / `frame-ancestors`, `Content-Security-Policy`. Missing headers
    on auth responses are HIGH severity.

  SECRETS & CONFIGURATION
  - Secrets management: grep for hardcoded credentials. Verify .env is gitignored.
  - Agent chassis security (AI-integrated codebases): secrets injected at deterministic
    runtime layer, not passed through AI context window; trust boundary around model calls;
    audit logging on all outbound agent actions.
  - Prompt injection defense (Google Workspace integrations): verify `--sanitize` flag
    used on Gmail/Drive/Sheets reads to block Model Armor injection.

  AI PLATFORM ATTACK SURFACE (for codebases with LLM/AI features)
  - Unauthenticated API endpoints: grep for API routes that serve AI/chat/assistant
    functionality without auth middleware. Check `/api/chat`, `/api/assistant`,
    `/api/completion`, `/api/prompt` and similar. Any unauthenticated endpoint that
    touches LLM infrastructure is CRITICAL.
  - SQL injection on JSON keys: standard parameterization protects VALUES but not
    column names or JSON key paths. Grep for dynamic key construction in queries
    (e.g., `jsonb_extract_path`, `->`, `->>` operators with user input as the key;
    `ORDER BY ${userInput}`; dynamic column selection). This bypasses prepared
    statements entirely — flag as HIGH.
  - System prompt access controls: verify system prompts are not exposed via any API
    response, debug endpoint, or error message. Check that system prompts cannot be
    read OR written by any user-facing endpoint. Write access to system prompts =
    CRITICAL (enables poisoned advice, guardrail removal, data exfiltration via
    prompt manipulation). Grep for: prompt storage tables, prompt config files,
    admin endpoints that modify assistant behavior.
  - RAG document chunk exposure: if the codebase uses RAG (vector search, embeddings,
    document retrieval), verify that retrieved chunks are access-controlled — users
    should only see chunks from documents they have permission to access. Grep for
    vector similarity queries that lack a WHERE clause on ownership/permissions.
  - AI assistant write permissions: check if any API allows modifying AI assistant
    configuration (model, temperature, tools, system prompt) without admin auth.
    Any user-writable assistant config is HIGH severity.

  FAIL-OPEN PATTERNS
  - grep for: catch blocks that continue past auth checks; env vars that enable features
    when missing; default roles of admin/superuser; `.catch(() => true)` on permission
    checks; boolean flags defaulting to true for allow/skip/bypass/public — for each hit,
    trace the code path to determine if the failure mode is permissive; flag CRITICAL if
    an auth guard silently no-ops on exception.

  STATIC ANALYSIS TOOLING (run when available)
  - Semgrep: `semgrep --config=auto --sarif -o .cto-review/semgrep.sarif {src_dirs} 2>/dev/null`
    Parse SARIF output for high/critical findings. Semgrep catches injection, XSS, and
    insecure defaults with low false-positive rate. If semgrep is not installed, skip silently.
  - npm audit / pip-audit: already included above — parse JSON output for actionable CVEs.
  - Custom Semgrep rules: if `.semgrep/` or `.semgrep.yml` exists in the project, run
    `semgrep --config=.semgrep/ --sarif` to pick up project-specific rules.

  DIFFERENTIAL REVIEW (when reviewing changes, not full codebase)
  - If the review is scoped to a PR or recent changes, run `git diff main...HEAD` first.
  - Focus security review on changed lines and their surrounding context (callers, callees).
  - For each changed function: trace data flow from input to output — does the change
    introduce a new path where untrusted data reaches a sensitive sink?
  - Apply the "attacker's diff" lens: what would a malicious actor gain from each change?
  - Cross-reference changed files against the OWASP ASVS category most relevant to
    the change (e.g., auth changes → V2 Authentication, API changes → V13 API Security).

  INSECURE DEFAULTS DETECTION
  - Grep for default configuration values that are permissive: `CORS: '*'`, `debug: true`,
    `secure: false`, `httpOnly: false`, `sameSite: 'none'`, `helmet()` called without options.
  - Check for missing security middleware: if Express/Fastify, verify helmet, cors with
    explicit origins, and rate-limiting are configured — not just installed.
  - Docker/deployment: if Dockerfile exists, check for `USER root` (should be non-root),
    exposed debug ports, and secrets in build args.

  CODE ARCHAEOLOGY (Glasswing-style deep vulnerability hunting)
  Glasswing's insight: the highest-impact vulnerabilities hide in code that survived
  years of expert review unchanged. Don't just scan for patterns — trace execution
  paths that cross trust boundaries, especially in old code.

  PHASE 1: IDENTIFY HIGH-VALUE TARGETS
  - Run `git log --format='%H %ai %s' --diff-filter=M -- {file}` on security-critical
    files (auth, crypto, parsers, serializers, FFI bindings, middleware, session mgmt).
  - Files with no meaningful changes in 2+ years are prime targets — old code predates
    modern security awareness and has ossified assumptions.
  - Identify "load-bearing" code: functions called from many places but rarely modified.
    These are single points of failure that developers are afraid to touch.
  - Check `git blame` for functions where the original author is no longer active —
    abandoned ownership = abandoned security assumptions.

  PHASE 2: TRACE TRUST BOUNDARIES
  The Glasswing pattern is not "grep for bad patterns" — it's "trace data from
  untrusted source to trusted sink and find where validation is assumed, not enforced."
  - For each target file, identify: What enters from outside? What exits to a
    privileged context? Where does the code assume input is already validated?
  - Map the "trust gradient": user input → validation → business logic → data store.
    Vulnerabilities cluster at gradient transitions where one layer trusts another
    to have already validated.
  - Check functions that were secure when written but became vulnerable due to
    callers added later that pass different input shapes (API evolution drift).

  PHASE 3: PATTERN-SPECIFIC HUNTING
  - Integer overflow in length/size calculations: grep for arithmetic on buffer sizes,
    packet lengths, array indices — especially in C/C++ FFI boundaries, binary parsers,
    and protocol implementations. Check for unchecked parseInt/Number() on user input
    used in allocation or slice operations.
  - Use-after-free / dangling references: in codebases with manual memory management or
    native addons (N-API, Rust FFI, WASM), check that freed resources are not referenced
    after cleanup. In JS/TS, check for event listeners or callbacks holding references to
    destroyed objects (DB connections, streams, WebSocket handles).
  - FFI/C boundary trust: any Buffer.from(), ArrayBuffer, DataView, or native addon
    call that receives user-controlled sizes or offsets without bounds checking. Native
    code trusts JS-provided lengths — overflow here escapes the JS sandbox.
  - Parser edge cases: custom parsers for CSV, XML, JSON, URL, multipart, or protocol
    buffers — check boundary conditions: empty input, maximum field counts, nested depth
    limits, null bytes in strings, encoding mismatches (UTF-8 vs Latin-1).
  - Implicit type coercion in security checks: == vs === on auth tokens, 0 == ""
    truthy comparisons in permission gates, Array.includes with type-coerced values.
  - State machine violations: auth/session code that uses multi-step flows (OAuth,
    MFA, password reset) — check if steps can be skipped, replayed, or reordered.
    Grep for state transitions that don't verify the previous state.
  - Race conditions in auth: check for TOCTOU gaps between permission check and
    resource access, especially in async code (await between authz check and DB write).
  - Deserialization sinks: JSON.parse, yaml.load, unsafe deserializers, eval,
    vm.runInContext receiving data that transited through a trust boundary — even
    if it was "validated" upstream, check if the validation is structurally complete
    (schema validation vs. key-exists check).

  PHASE 4: CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS (what Glasswing does that scanners can't)
  - Read the COMMIT MESSAGE and PR description for security-critical changes —
    understand the developer's INTENT, then check if the implementation matches.
    Bugs often live in the gap between "what the dev meant" and "what the code does."
  - Check error paths: the happy path is reviewed; the error/exception path is where
    auth state leaks, partial writes corrupt data, and cleanup skips happen.
  - Look for "defensive code that doesn't defend": try/catch blocks around auth that
    return default-allow on exception, validation functions that log-and-continue,
    middleware that calls next() in both the success and error branches.
  - Cross-function invariant violations: Function A assumes B already validated input.
    Function B assumes A already validated input. Neither validates. Trace the actual
    call chain to verify someone actually checks.

  Priority: CODE ARCHAEOLOGY findings are HIGH minimum. Findings involving trust
  boundary violations in code unchanged 2+ years are CRITICAL — these are the class
  of bugs that survive expert review and are only found by deep contextual analysis.

  Routing hint: For auth flows, Supabase RLS policies, and multi-hop data flow issues,
  note in your findings that these are strong candidates for Claude Code Security
  (AI-assisted SAST that traces data flows and catches business logic flaws that
  semgrep/trivy miss — found 500+ vulns in production OSS that survived expert review).
  This is especially relevant for Contably (Supabase RLS) and SourceRank (GitHub API access control).
  Report: severity | file:line | CWE | issue | recommendation
  When SARIF output is available, include the Semgrep rule ID in findings for traceability.
  Message the lead with CRITICAL findings immediately (don't wait for completion).
  Message quality-analyst if you find deprecated/vulnerable dependencies they should flag.
  Do NOT broadcast. When done, message the lead with your summary.

Teammate "performance-analyst":
  Review {db_files} and {api_files} for performance bottlenecks.
  FILE OWNERSHIP: You own {db_dirs}, {service_dirs}, and build/bundle config.

  Checklist:

  DATABASE
  - N+1 queries: ORM loops calling DB inside array.map/forEach — must use
    batch fetch (findMany with `in`, DataLoader, or joined query).
  - Index coverage: WHERE / ORDER BY / JOIN columns without indexes on high-cardinality tables.
  - Missing pagination: unbounded queries returning potentially large result sets.
  - Connection pooling: verify pool is configured (PgBouncer, Prisma connection limit,
    Supabase `?connection_limit=`). Serverless deployments creating a new connection
    per request will exhaust the DB.

  NEXT.JS / RSC CACHING (if Next.js App Router is in use)
  - "use cache" coverage: identify Server Components or data fetching functions that
    are not-user-specific and tolerate staleness — they should use `"use cache"` + `cacheLife()`.
    Missing cache on product catalogs, blog posts, and config data is a HIGH opportunity.
  - Caching anti-pattern — `connection()` overuse: grep for `await connection()` at page
    level. Using `connection()` makes the entire route dynamic. Replace with Suspense
    boundaries isolating only the truly dynamic parts.
  - cacheTag invalidation gaps: Server Actions that mutate data without calling
    `revalidateTag()` cause stale reads. Cross-reference mutation paths against cacheTag usage.
  - Dynamic API leakage into cached scope: `cookies()`, `headers()`, `searchParams` called
    inside a `"use cache"` function — this throws at runtime. Must be extracted outside
    and passed as arguments.
  - Route vs data cache confusion: `fetch()` calls without explicit `cache` or `next.revalidate`
    options — verify intentional caching behavior (Next.js 15 defaults fetch to no-store).
  - Full Route Cache vs Data Cache invalidation: confirm that `revalidateTag()` is used
    after mutations (granular) rather than `revalidatePath('/')` (nukes entire route cache).
  - PPR (Partial Prerendering): if `experimental.ppr` is enabled, check Suspense boundary
    placement — static shell should be outermost, dynamic content innermost.

  FRONTEND / BUNDLE
  - Bundle size: identify heavy dependencies imported without tree-shaking (lodash,
    moment, full icon libraries). Flag `import * as X from` patterns.
  - Memory leaks: event listeners or intervals not cleared in useEffect cleanup.
  - Async handling: blocking await chains that could run in parallel — prefer
    `Promise.all([...])` for independent async operations.

  API / NETWORK
  - Rate limiting: confirm external API calls are guarded (retries with backoff,
    not unbounded retry loops).
  - Streaming: large data responses that could be streamed (SSE, RSC streaming)
    but are blocking.

```

**File ownership boundaries** prevent analysts from duplicating work or producing conflicting observations about the same file. Each analyst reads only their assigned directories deeply; they may skim other areas for cross-references but must not include them in their own findings.

**Messaging discipline:**

- Direct messages only. Never broadcast.
- Message another analyst ONLY if your finding directly affects their domain.
- Message the lead for: critical findings, completion, blockers.
- Do NOT message for: progress updates (lead gets idle notifications), acknowledgments.

**Lead orchestrator behavior:**

- When an analyst messages completion → update task status → shut them down immediately
- When an analyst reports a critical finding → log it for the synthesis
- When all analysts complete → proceed to synthesis (3.2)
- If an analyst times out (>5 min) → synthesize available findings, mark incomplete

**Task mode (fallback):**

When Agent Teams is unavailable, spawn via Task tool with `run_in_background: true`. Use the same file ownership boundaries and reporting format above, but analysts write findings to `.cto-review/{analyst-name}.md` instead of messaging. The lead polls for file completion.

#### 3.2: Parallel Swarm Findings Synthesis

> **ASMR Synthesis Pattern:** Instead of a single orchestrator doing severity ranking, cross-concern detection, and effort estimation sequentially, spawn 3-4 specialist synthesis agents in parallel. Each agent analyzes the raw analyst findings from a different perspective, then results are merged into the final report. Based on Supermemory's ASMR answering architecture (parallel specialist prompt variants). This catches cross-domain interactions that single-pass synthesis misses.

After all analysts complete (or timeout), collect all raw findings, then spawn 3 parallel synthesis agents (model: haiku) via Task tool with `run_in_background: true`:

```
Synthesis Agent "severity-ranker" (haiku):
  Input: {all raw analyst findings as JSON}
  Task: Rank every finding by severity using these rules:
  - CRITICAL: production outage risk, data loss, security breach, auth bypass
  - HIGH: significant performance degradation, major security flaw, data integrity risk
  - MEDIUM: code quality issues affecting maintainability, moderate performance impact
  - LOW: style issues, minor tech debt, nice-to-have improvements
  For findings at boundary between levels, err toward the higher severity.
  Output: JSON array of {finding_id, severity, justification}

Synthesis Agent "cross-concern-detector" (haiku):
  Input: {all raw analyst findings as JSON, grouped by analyst}
  Task: Find cross-concern patterns:
  1. SAME FILE flagged by 2+ analysts → elevate one severity level
  2. SAME ISSUE TYPE across 3+ files → flag as emerging pattern
  3. CONTRADICTIONS between analysts (one says "good", another says "bad") → flag for lead review
  4. REINFORCEMENTS where multiple analysts confirm the same root cause
  Examples:
  - architecture finds loop in orders.ts + performance confirms N+1 → elevate to HIGH
  - security finds vulnerable lodash + quality finds deprecated usage → consolidate
  - quality finds missing error handling in 5 files + security finds unhandled auth → emerging pattern
  Output: JSON with {elevations[], emergingPatterns[], contradictions[], consolidations[]}

Synthesis Agent "effort-estimator" (haiku):
  Input: {all raw analyst findings as JSON}
  Task: For each finding, estimate implementation effort:
  - QUICK WIN: <1 hour, single file change, low risk
  - MODERATE: 1-4 hours, multiple files, some testing needed
  - SIGNIFICANT: 1-2 days, architectural change, thorough testing
  - MAJOR: 3+ days, cross-cutting refactor, migration planning
  Also identify the optimal fix ORDER (dependencies between fixes,
  quick wins that unblock larger changes).
  Output: JSON array of {finding_id, effort, dependencies[], quickWin: boolean}
```

**Merge synthesis results:**

After all 3 synthesis agents complete, the lead orchestrator merges:

1. Apply severity rankings from severity-ranker
2. Apply elevations from cross-concern-detector (override severity where cross-concerns found)
3. Consolidate duplicate findings flagged by cross-concern-detector
4. Annotate each finding with effort estimate
5. Sort: critical quick-wins first, then critical significant, then high quick-wins, etc.
6. Generate the unified executive report (Step 4 format)

**Fallback:** If Task tool is unavailable or findings are <10, do single-pass synthesis (the lead merges findings directly using the rules above).

### Step 3-Alt: Sequential Analysis (For Focused Reviews)

> **Advisor Pattern (v3.1):** In sequential mode, the CTO skill can run as a Sonnet executor with Opus advisor.
> Sonnet handles codebase exploration, file reading, and report generation. When a judgment call is needed
> (architecture trade-off, security severity assessment, technology recommendation), Sonnet invokes the Opus
> advisor via tool call. This delivers near-Opus quality at ~70% lower cost for typical sequential reviews.
> The advisor shares the full conversation context, so no information is lost.

Use sequential mode when:

- Answering a specific question ("Should we use GraphQL?")
- Focused single-area review ("Just check security")
- Limited context/time available

#### Architecture Review

**Check component organization:**

```bash
# Find main source directories
find . -type d -name "src" -o -name "app" -o -name "lib" -o -name "components" 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Analyze imports/dependencies
grep -r "import.*from" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" | head -50
```

**Identify patterns:**

- Circular dependencies
- God components/modules
- Proper separation of concerns
- API layer architecture
- Database access patterns

**Create findings report:**

```markdown
## Architecture Review Findings

### Strengths

- [What's done well]

### Areas for Improvement

| Area   | Current State | Recommendation | Priority     |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| [Area] | [Issue]       | [Fix]          | HIGH/MED/LOW |

### Recommended Refactoring

1. [Specific action with rationale]
```

#### Code Quality Assessment

**Check for code smells:**

```bash
# Large files (potential god objects)
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" \) ! -path '*/node_modules/*' -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | head -20

# Complex functions (many if/else, deep nesting)
grep -rn "if.*{" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -30

# TODO/FIXME comments
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" | head -20
```

**Review testing:**

```bash
# Test file coverage
find . -type f \( -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.py" \) ! -path '*/node_modules/*' | wc -l

# Source file count for comparison
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" \) ! -path '*/node_modules/*' ! -name "*.test.*" ! -name "*.spec.*" | wc -l
```

#### Security Audit

**Run static analysis tooling (when available):**

```bash
# Semgrep (SAST) — low false-positive, catches injection/XSS/insecure-defaults
semgrep --config=auto --sarif -o .cto-review/semgrep.sarif . 2>/dev/null && echo "Semgrep: $(cat .cto-review/semgrep.sarif | jq '.runs[0].results | length') findings"

# Project-specific Semgrep rules (if configured)
[ -f .semgrep.yml ] && semgrep --config=.semgrep.yml --sarif -o .cto-review/semgrep-custom.sarif . 2>/dev/null

# If reviewing a PR/branch diff, scope the analysis
# semgrep --config=auto --sarif --diff-depth=0 --baseline-commit=main . 2>/dev/null
```

If Semgrep SARIF output is available, parse it for HIGH/CRITICAL findings and include the rule ID in the report for traceability (e.g., `semgrep:javascript.express.security.injection.tainted-sql-string`).

**Check for common vulnerabilities (grep fallback when Semgrep unavailable):**

```bash
# Hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "password\s*=\|api_key\s*=\|secret\s*=\|token\s*=" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" ! -path '*/node_modules/*' | head -20

# SQL injection risks
grep -rn "query.*\$\|execute.*\$\|raw.*\$" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" | head -20

# eval usage
grep -rn "\beval\b\|exec\b" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" | head -10
```

**Check for insecure defaults / fail-open patterns:**

Secure code fails **closed** (denies access on error). Insecure code fails **open** (grants access, skips the check, or defaults to a permissive state when config is missing).

```bash
# Exception handlers that continue past auth/permission checks
# (catch blocks followed by no re-throw and no explicit denial)
grep -rn -A 5 "catch\s*(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | grep -A 5 "auth\|permission\|role\|token\|session" | head -40

# Null/undefined user or role treated as valid (fail-open on missing identity)
grep -rn "if.*user\b\|if.*role\b\|if.*session\b" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | grep -v "!" | head -20

# Config flags that enable features when env var is missing (should default to disabled)
grep -rn "process\.env\." --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | grep -v "??\||| " | grep -i "enable\|allow\|skip\|bypass\|disable" | head -20

# Boolean flags with insecure defaults
grep -rn "=\s*true\b" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | grep -i "allow\|skip\|bypass\|open\|public\|insecure\|disable" | head -20
```

For each hit, trace the code path: determine whether the condition evaluates to a permissive outcome when the guard variable is falsy, null, undefined, or an exception is thrown. Flag the following patterns explicitly:

| Fail-open pattern                            | Example                                                     | Verdict      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Auth check in try/catch with silent catch    | `try { verifyToken(t) } catch { }` then continues           | **CRITICAL** |
| Missing env var enables feature              | `const debug = process.env.DEBUG_MODE` used as `if (debug)` | **HIGH**     |
| Default role is admin/superuser              | `const role = user?.role ?? 'admin'`                        | **CRITICAL** |
| Permission check returns true on error       | `canAccess().catch(() => true)`                             | **CRITICAL** |
| Guard only checks truthy, not explicit value | `if (isAdmin)` where isAdmin could be any truthy string     | **HIGH**     |

**Check dependencies:**

```bash
# Run security audit if available
npm audit 2>/dev/null | head -50
pip-audit 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**Differential review (when reviewing changes, not full codebase):**

If the review is scoped to a PR, branch, or recent changes:

```bash
# Get the diff to focus on
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
git diff main...HEAD --stat
```

For each changed file:

1. Read the full diff context (not just changed lines)
2. Trace data flow: does the change introduce a new path where untrusted data reaches a sensitive sink?
3. Apply the "attacker's diff" lens: what would a malicious actor gain from each change?
4. Cross-reference against OWASP ASVS: auth changes → V2, API changes → V13, crypto → V6, config → V14
5. Check for regressions: does the change remove or weaken an existing security control?

**Insecure defaults detection:**

```bash
# Permissive CORS
grep -rn "cors\|Access-Control-Allow-Origin" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | grep -i "'\*'\|\"\\*\"" | head -10

# Missing security middleware
grep -rn "helmet\|csrf\|csurf\|rate.limit" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | head -10

# Docker security (if applicable)
[ -f Dockerfile ] && grep -n "USER\|EXPOSE\|ARG\|ENV" Dockerfile | head -10
```

Check for: `CORS: '*'`, `debug: true` in production, `secure: false` on cookies, `httpOnly: false`, `sameSite: 'none'`, `helmet()` without options, Docker running as root, secrets in build args.

#### Performance Analysis

**Check for performance issues:**

```bash
# N+1 query patterns (multiple similar queries)
grep -rn "\.find\|\.findOne\|\.query\|\.select" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" | head -30

# Missing indexes hints
grep -rn "ORDER BY\|GROUP BY\|WHERE" --include="*.sql" | head -20

# Large bundle concerns
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | jq '.dependencies' 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

**Next.js App Router caching checks (if applicable):**

```bash
# Find uncached Server Components that fetch data (missed "use cache" opportunities)
grep -rn "async function\|export async" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "use cache" | head -20

# Check for connection() overuse (makes entire route dynamic)
grep -rn "await connection()" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | head -10

# Find Server Actions that mutate without revalidation
grep -rn "revalidateTag\|revalidatePath" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20

# Detect dynamic API leakage into cached scope
grep -rn "cookies()\|headers()\|searchParams" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20
```

When reviewing Next.js App Router code, check:

- Server Components fetching non-user data without `"use cache"` + `cacheLife()` — HIGH opportunity
- `connection()` at page level instead of Suspense boundary isolation — escalates full route to dynamic
- Server Actions mutating DB without `revalidateTag()` on affected cache tags — causes stale reads
- `fetch()` calls without explicit `cache` / `next.revalidate` — Next.js 15 defaults to no-store
- `"use cache: private"` + client navigation issues (known bug in 16.1.x — prefer user-scoped tags)
- Partial Prerendering: if `experimental.ppr` enabled, verify Suspense boundaries maximize static shell

## Appendix: Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: [Title]

**Status:** Proposed
**Context:** [Why is this decision needed?]
**Decision:** [What is the proposed solution?]
**Consequences:** [What are the trade-offs?]
```

### Step 4b: Cross-Reference Findings with Memory

After generating findings, check memory for known patterns to enrich the report with historical context:

```bash
# Check for known common bugs that match current findings
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "common-bug"

# Check for tech insights relevant to the stack/issues found
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "tech-insight"
```

If any current findings match known patterns from memory:

- Note them as **recurring issues** in the report (e.g., "This N+1 query pattern was also found in [previous project] on [date]")
- Elevate their priority — recurring patterns indicate systemic habits, not one-off mistakes
- Include the memory entity reference so the user can trace the history

### Step 5: Present and Discuss

**Present findings:**

```
## CTO Assessment Complete

I've analyzed your codebase. Here's a summary:

**Overall Health:** [Good/Fair/Needs Attention]

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. [Priority 1] - [Severity]
2. [Priority 2] - [Severity]
3. [Priority 3] - [Severity]

**Quick Wins Available:** [Y/N - list if yes]

Would you like me to:
A. Show the full detailed report
B. Focus on security findings
C. Deep dive into architecture
D. Create a refactoring plan
```

### Step 6: Implementation Handoff

**IMPORTANT:** After presenting recommendations, ALWAYS ask the user before implementing:

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to prompt:

```
question: "Would you like me to implement these recommendations using /autonomous-dev?"
header: "Implement"
options:
  - label: "Yes, implement all (Recommended)"
    description: "Launch autonomous-dev to implement all prioritized recommendations"
  - label: "Yes, implement selected"
    description: "Choose which recommendations to implement"
  - label: "No, just the report"
    description: "Keep the analysis - I'll implement manually"
```

**If user selects "Yes, implement all":**

1. Create a structured PRD from the recommendations
2. Invoke `/autonomous-dev` skill with the PRD
3. Let autonomous-dev handle the implementation

**If user selects "Yes, implement selected":**

1. Present numbered list of recommendations
2. Ask which items to implement
3. Create focused PRD for selected items
4. Invoke `/autonomous-dev` with the scoped PRD

**If user selects "No, just the report":**

1. Confirm the report is saved (if written to file)
2. Offer to answer any questions about findings
3. End the CTO session

**NEVER implement recommendations without explicit user approval.**

---

## Completion Signals

This skill explicitly signals completion via structured status returns. Never rely on heuristics like "consecutive iterations without tool calls" to detect completion.

### Completion Signal Format

At the end of analysis, return:

```json
{
  "status": "complete|partial|blocked|failed",
  "analysisType": "sequential|swarm",
  "summary": "Brief description of findings",
  "findings": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  },
  "reports": ["List of generated reports"],
  "userActionRequired": "What user should do next (if any)"
}
```

### Success Signal (Sequential Mode)

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "analysisType": "sequential",
  "summary": "Completed focused security audit of authentication system",
  "findings": {
    "critical": 1,
    "high": 2,
    "medium": 3,
    "low": 5
  },
  "reports": [".testing/reports/cto-security-audit-2026-01-30.md"],

```

### Blocked Signal

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "analysisType": "sequential",
  "summary": "Cannot access codebase - directory not readable",

    "Use 'sequential' mode instead of 'swarm'",
    "Enable TeammateTool support",
    "Reduce scope to specific area (e.g., security only)"
  ]
}
```

### When to Signal

- **After sequential analysis**: Signal "complete" when report is generated and user prompt shown
- **After swarm analysis**: Signal "complete" when all analysts finish and synthesis is done
- **During swarm**: Signal "partial" if some analysts timeout but others complete
- **Any blocker**: Signal "blocked" immediately (e.g., codebase not found, permissions issue)
- **Any failure**: Signal "failed" with clear error and recovery path
- **Before implementation**: Always signal "complete" and wait for user approval before invoking autonomous-dev

## Security Checklist

### Application Security

- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding (XSS prevention)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Rate limiting on APIs
- [ ] Secure session management

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)
- [ ] Secrets in environment variables / secret manager
- [ ] Principle of least privilege (IAM)
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security headers configured

### Agent Chassis Security (AI-Integrated Apps)

- [ ] AI model context treated as untrusted — no raw credentials in prompts
- [ ] Secrets injected by deterministic runtime (chassis), not by or through the model
- [ ] Trust boundary exists around model calls (sandbox, allow-list, guardrails)
- [ ] All outbound agent actions and secret accesses audit-logged

### Claude Code Tool Security (Dev Environment Supply Chain)

- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` reviewed — no untrusted hooks (`hooks.*` can execute arbitrary shell commands = RCE)
- [ ] `.mcp.json` reviewed — no rogue MCP server configs (malicious servers execute before trust dialogs)
- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` not overridden in project settings (enables API key exfiltration to attacker proxy)
- [ ] `.claude/` and `.mcp.json` included in PR review checklists (attack vector via malicious PRs/dependencies)
- [ ] Tool trust dialogs not bypassed with `--dangerouslySkipPermissions` in CI/CD

### Data Security

- [ ] Encryption at rest
- [ ] Encryption in transit
- [ ] PII handling compliance
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Audit logging

## Memory Integration

Save valuable insights to Memory MCP for cross-project learning:

**When to save:**

- Discovered an architectural pattern that worked well
- Found a security vulnerability pattern to avoid
- Learned something about a specific technology
- Made a strategic decision that proved successful

**Entity types:**

```javascript
// Save architectural pattern
mcp__memory__create_entities({
  entities: [
    {
      name: "architecture:pattern-name",
      entityType: "architecture-decision",
      observations: [
        "Context: when to use",
        "Pattern: what it is",
        "Benefits: why it works",
        "Trade-offs: what to watch for",
      ],
    },
  ],
});

// Save security learning
mcp__memory__create_entities({
  entities: [
    {
      name: "security:vulnerability-type",
      entityType: "security-insight",
      observations: [
        "Vulnerability: description",
        "Detection: how to find it",
        "Prevention: how to avoid it",
        "Applies to: frameworks/languages",
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

---

## Swarm Mode Configuration

Enable swarm mode in your `cto-requirements.md`:

```markdown
## Execution Mode

mode: swarm # or "sequential"

## Swarm Configuration

swarm:
max_concurrent_analysts: 5
timeout_seconds: 300
critical_finding_action: immediate_notify
cross_concern_detection: true
live_dashboard: true
```

Or configure globally:

```json
{
  "cto": {
    "defaultMode": "swarm",
    "swarmConfig": {
      "analysts": ["security", "architecture", "performance", "quality"],
      "priorityOrder": ["security", "performance", "architecture", "quality"],
      "timeoutSeconds": 300,
      "crossConcernDetection": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Swarm vs Sequential Comparison

| Aspect            | Sequential               | Swarm                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Execution         | One area at a time       | All areas concurrent |
| Duration          | Sum of all analyses      | Max of all analyses  |
| Cross-Concerns    | Manual correlation       | Auto-detected        |
| Critical Findings | Found after all complete | Immediately surfaced |
| Token Usage       | Lower (single context)   | Higher (4 contexts)  |
| Best For          | Focused questions        | Full codebase review |

### When to Use Each Mode

**Use Swarm Mode:**

- Full codebase review ("Review this project as CTO")
- Pre-launch audit
- New project onboarding
- Quarterly health check
- Due diligence review

**Use Sequential Mode:**

- Specific question ("Is our auth secure?")
- Single area focus ("Review architecture only")
- Quick check before PR
- Limited time available

---

## Task Cleanup

Use `TaskUpdate` with `status: "deleted"` to clean up completed or stale task chains:

```json
{ "taskId": "1", "status": "deleted" }
```

This prevents task list clutter during long review sessions.

---

## Model Configuration

This skill uses Claude Opus 4.6 for maximum capability. Use `/fast` to toggle faster responses when time is critical.

## Hook Events

This skill leverages:

- **TeammateIdle**: Triggers when a teammate goes idle (swarm mode)
- **TaskCompleted**: Triggers when a task is marked completed

## Quick Commands

| Command                 | Action                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "status"                | Show current review progress                |
| "focus [area]"          | Narrow review to specific area (sequential) |
| "swarm review"          | Force swarm mode for full analysis          |
| "deep dive [component]" | Detailed analysis of component              |
| "create adr"            | Generate Architecture Decision Record       |
| "implement"             | Prompt for /autonomous-dev implementation   |
| "plan refactor"         | Create refactoring roadmap                  |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### With autonomous-dev

When CTO review identifies refactoring needs:

```
CTO identifies issue → Asks user for approval → Creates refactoring PRD → autonomous-dev implements
```

**Note:** CTO always asks before invoking autonomous-dev. Never auto-implement.

### With fulltest-skill

CTO reads fulltest reports for context:

```
fulltest finds bugs → CTO analyzes patterns → Recommends systemic fixes
```

### With cpo-ai-skill

CTO serves as technical advisor during product development:

```
CPO defines product → CTO advises architecture → Implementation proceeds
```

---

## Example Invocations

### Swarm Mode: Full Review

```
User: "Review this codebase as a CTO"

CTO Advisor (Swarm Mode):
1. Checks for cto-requirements.md
2. Performs codebase discovery
3. Spawns 5 parallel analysts via TeammateTool:
   - security-analyst
   - architecture-analyst
   - performance-analyst
   - quality-analyst
   - quality-analyst

# Real-time output:
[0:15] security-analyst: 🔍 Scanning auth patterns...
[0:22] architecture-analyst: 🔍 Mapping component boundaries...
[0:28] security-analyst: 🚨 CRITICAL: Hardcoded JWT secret found
[0:35] performance-analyst: ⚠️ N+1 query detected in orders
[0:42] architecture-analyst → performance-analyst: "Check service loop pattern"
[0:55] performance-analyst: ✅ Confirmed N+1 (cross-concern with architecture)
[1:10] quality-analyst: ℹ️ Test coverage at 45%
[1:25] security-analyst: ⚠️ 3 vulnerable dependencies found

# Synthesis (live as findings arrive):
- Critical: 1 (security)
- High: 3 (security, performance, stack)
- Medium: 5
- Cross-concerns detected: 2

4. Generates executive report
5. Asks: "Would you like me to implement fixes using /autonomous-dev?"
```

### Sequential Mode: Focused Security Audit

```
User: "Do a security audit of the authentication system"

CTO Advisor (Sequential Mode):
1. Locates auth-related files
2. Reviews authentication flow
3. Checks for OWASP vulnerabilities
4. Reviews session management
5. Checks secrets handling
6. Generates security-focused report
```

### Swarm Mode: Pre-Launch Audit

```
User: "We're launching next week - full CTO review please"

CTO Advisor (Swarm Mode):
1. Spawns all 4 analysts with "launch_readiness" focus
2. Each analyst prioritizes launch-blocking issues
3. Cross-concern detection catches:
   - Security + Performance: "Rate limiting missing on public API"
   - Architecture + Quality: "No error boundary in React app"
4. Generates launch readiness checklist:
   ❌ 2 blockers (must fix)
   ⚠️ 5 should fix
   ℹ️ 8 nice to have
5. Creates prioritized fix plan for autonomous-dev
```

### Architecture Decision

```
User: "Should we migrate from REST to GraphQL?"

CTO Advisor (Sequential - focused question):
1. Analyzes current REST implementation
2. Evaluates GraphQL fit for use cases
3. Considers team expertise
4. Calculates migration effort
5. Provides scored recommendation
6. Creates ADR for decision
```

## MCP Tool Usage Guide

This skill has access to several MCP servers and web tools. Use the right one for each situation:

| Need                       | Tool                           | When                                                                | Token Cost |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Quick web lookup           | `WebSearch`                    | Checking best practices, CVE details, framework docs                | Low        |
| Read a single page         | `WebFetch`                     | Reading a specific URL (blog post, docs page, advisory)             | Low        |
| Deep site crawl            | `mcp__firecrawl__*`            | Crawling multiple pages, extracting structured data from docs sites | High       |
| Save cross-project insight | `mcp__memory__create_entities` | Architectural decisions or patterns with relevance >= 5             | Low        |
| Recall past insights       | `mcp__memory__search_nodes`    | Check if this project/pattern was reviewed before                   | Low        |

**Decision rules:**

- **Default to `WebSearch` + `WebFetch`** for research. Only escalate to Firecrawl when you need to crawl multiple linked pages or extract structured data that WebFetch can't render.
- **Never use Firecrawl for a single page.** `WebFetch` handles that at ~10x lower token cost.
- **Memory writes require relevance >= 5.** Auto-memory captures session context already — only save structured architectural decisions and cross-concern insights to MCP Memory.
- **Bash + CLI first** for git operations (`git log`, `git blame`, `git diff`), dependency checks (`npm audit`, `pnpm outdated`), and system checks. These cost zero MCP overhead.
