# Meditate Skill

End-of-session judgment extraction. Runs after completing substantial work (`/ship`, `/cto`, `/parallel-dev`, `/deep-plan`, or any long session) to capture learnings before context is lost.

This is the **intake step** for the memory pipeline. `/consolidate` is the **maintenance step**. Together they form the full memory lifecycle: meditate captures, consolidate prunes and promotes.

## When to Run

- After completing a `/ship` cycle
- After a `/cto` review (especially swarm mode)
- After `/parallel-dev` finishes all features
- After `/deep-plan` implementation
- After any session >30 minutes with meaningful code changes
- When the user says `/meditate` or "reflect on session"
- **Periodic nudge (auto-trigger):** When invoked by a hook or scheduler after N turns of activity, not just at session end

## Phase 0: Periodic Nudge (Hermes "Subconscious" Pattern)

> Instead of only firing at session end, `/meditate` can run as a **periodic nudge** — a lightweight check injected every N turns (default: 10) or on task completion events. This is the mechanism that makes memory compound autonomously.

### How It Works

1. A hook or the Claudia router triggers `/meditate` with context flag `nudge=true`
2. In nudge mode, skip the full ASMR Observer pattern — use the **Fallback: Single-Agent Mode** (5-question method) instead
3. Only persist findings that score >= 7 (higher bar than end-of-session to avoid noise)
4. Complete in <30 seconds — nudges must not block the conversation flow

### Nudge Mode Detection

```
IF invocation context includes "nudge=true" OR "periodic" OR "auto-trigger":
  → Run Phase 0 (lightweight single-agent extraction)
  → Use score threshold 7 (not 5)
  → Skip Phase 5 report (silent save)
  → Max 2 entities per nudge

ELSE:
  → Run full meditation (Phase 1-5 as below)
```

### Integration Points

- **Claudia router:** After every 10th message per session, fire `/meditate nudge=true` async
- **Claude Code hooks:** `TaskCompleted` and `TeammateIdle` hooks can trigger nudge mode
- **Scheduler:** Cron job can trigger daily reflection nudge on active agents

## Phase 1: Gather Session Context via Parallel Observers

> **ASMR Observer Pattern:** Instead of a single agent scanning all sources sequentially, spawn 2-3 parallel Observer agents that each read a subset of session context and extract structured facts across specialized vectors. Based on Supermemory's ASMR ingestion architecture (3 parallel Observers). This catches cross-cutting patterns that sequential scanning misses.

**Step 1: Pre-read shared context** (orchestrator does this once, passes to all observers):

```bash
# Quick context snapshot — shared with all observers
git log --oneline -20 2>/dev/null
git diff --stat HEAD~10..HEAD 2>/dev/null
ls .ship/state.json .deep-plan/plan.md .parallel-dev/features.json .cto/last-review.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 2: Spawn 2-3 Observer agents** (model: haiku) in parallel via Task tool with `run_in_background: true`:

```
Observer "code-observer" (haiku):
  Context: {git log, git diff stat, state files from Step 1}
  Read the git log and changed files to extract:

  EXTRACTION VECTORS:
  1. Technical Patterns — reusable code patterns, framework idioms, API patterns
  2. Mistakes & Fixes — things that broke, what caused them, how they were fixed
  3. Architecture Decisions — structural choices made and their rationale

  For each finding, output: {type, summary, specifics, severity, generalizability}
  Be specific: "Supabase RLS policies need anon key, not service key" not "Supabase is tricky"
  Include the fix for every mistake. Include the trigger for every pattern.
  Max 3 findings. Quality over quantity.

Observer "preference-observer" (haiku):
  Context: {auto-memory entries from today, conversation history summary}
  Read today's auto-memory entries (~/.claude-setup/memory/auto/*.md modified today)
  and any state files for user preference signals:

  EXTRACTION VECTORS:
  1. User Preferences — explicit statements ("always do X", "don't use Y")
  2. Workflow Patterns — how the user likes to work, tool preferences, style choices
  3. Temporal Updates — facts that CONTRADICT or UPDATE previous knowledge

  For each finding, output: {type, summary, specifics, confidence, source}
  Pay special attention to corrections and contradictions — these are high-value.
  Max 2 findings. Only save if the user explicitly stated or strongly implied it.

Observer "impact-observer" (haiku):  # Only spawn if session was >30 min or had failures
  Context: {git log, state files}
  Analyze the session for cross-cutting IMPACT:

  EXTRACTION VECTORS:
  1. Cross-Project Applicability — would this insight help in other projects?
  2. Failure Severity — could ignoring this cause production issues?
  3. Knowledge Gaps — what did we NOT know that we should have?

  For each finding, output: {type, summary, applicability[], severity, gap_description}
  Max 2 findings. Only high-generalizability insights.
```

**Step 3: Merge Observer outputs**

After all observers complete, merge their findings into a unified candidate list:

```
1. Collect all findings from all observers
2. Deduplicate: if two observers found the same insight, keep the more specific one
3. Cap at 5 total candidates (quality over quantity)
4. Each candidate maps to an entity type:
```

| Finding Type          | Maps To                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Technical Pattern     | `pattern:` entity      |
| Mistake & Fix         | `mistake:` entity      |
| Architecture Decision | `architecture:` entity |
| User Preference       | `preference:` entity   |
| Technology Learning   | `tech-insight:` entity |

### Extraction Rules

- **Be specific.** "Supabase RLS policies need to be tested with anon key, not service key" is good. "Supabase is tricky" is useless.
- **Include the fix.** Every `mistake:` should include what the correct approach is.
- **Include the trigger.** Every `pattern:` should include when to apply it.
- **Max 5 entities per session.** If you find more, keep only the 5 most generalizable. Quality over quantity.

### Fallback: Single-Agent Mode

If the session was short (<15 min) or produced minimal changes (<3 commits), skip the parallel observers and extract directly using the 5-question method:

| #   | Question                                  | Maps To                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Did something break that shouldn't have?  | `mistake:` entity      |
| 2   | Did I discover a reusable pattern?        | `pattern:` entity      |
| 3   | Did I learn something about a technology? | `tech-insight:` entity |
| 4   | Did the user express a preference?        | `preference:` entity   |
| 5   | Was an architecture decision made?        | `architecture:` entity |

## Phase 3: Score and Filter

For each candidate, calculate a quick relevance score using the criteria from memory-consolidation:

| Factor                       | Points    | Check                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Applies to multiple projects | +2 to +3  | Would this help in Contably AND SourceRank?  |
| Learned from failure         | +2        | Did something break?                         |
| User explicitly stated       | +3        | Did the user say "always do X"?              |
| High severity                | +3 to +5  | Could ignoring this cause production issues? |
| Common scenario              | +2        | Will this come up again within a week?       |
| Similar memory exists        | -2        | Check Memory MCP first                       |
| Duplicate (>85%)             | -Infinity | Skip entirely                                |

**Threshold: 5.** Only save entities scoring >= 5.

## Phase 4: Save to Memory

### Storage Backend Selection

Check which storage backend is available:

```
IF mcp__memory__* tools are available (test with mcp__memory__search_nodes):
  → Use Memory MCP (primary path below)
ELSE:
  → Use file-based auto-memory fallback (write to ~/.claude-setup/memory/auto/)
```

**File-based fallback:** When Memory MCP is unavailable, write each entity as a markdown file following the auto-memory format:

```markdown
---
name: {type}_{kebab-case-identifier}
description: {one-line description}
type: {feedback|project|reference|user}
---

{The actual learning — specific, actionable}

Discovered: {date}
Source: session — {skill or context}
Relevance score: {calculated score}
```

Then update `~/.claude-setup/memory/auto/MEMORY.md` index with a pointer to the new file. Use `mem-search` for dedup and `--reindex` after writes as normal.

### Deduplicate via mem-search

Before creating any new entity, check for existing similar memories using FTS5 search:

```bash
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "<entity-type> <key-learning-keywords>"
```

- If a result comes back with **score >= 5.0** and covers the same insight, **do not create a new entity**. Instead, add observations to the existing memory via `mcp__memory__add_observations` (e.g., "Applied in: {project} - {date} - HELPFUL", updated use count).
- If a result comes back with **score >= 3.0** but is only partially overlapping, create the new entity and add a `supersedes` or `related_to` relation to the existing one.
- If no relevant results, proceed with creation as normal.

This prevents the memory graph from accumulating near-duplicate entries across sessions.

### Create new entities

For each entity that passes the filter:

```javascript
await mcp__memory__create_entities({
  entities: [
    {
      name: "{type}:{kebab-case-identifier}",
      entityType: "{type}", // pattern, mistake, tech-insight, preference, architecture
      observations: [
        "{the actual learning — specific, actionable, includes context}",
        "Discovered: {today's date}",
        "Source: session — {skill or context that triggered this}",
        "Relevance score: {calculated score}",
        "Use count: 0",
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Create Relations

If the new entity relates to existing memories, create relations:

```javascript
// Check for related existing memories
const related = await mcp__memory__search_nodes({
  query: "{relevant keyword}",
});

// If found, create relation
await mcp__memory__create_relations({
  relations: [
    {
      from: "{new-entity-name}",
      relationType: "related_to", // or derived_from, applies_to, supersedes
      to: "{existing-entity-name}",
    },
  ],
});
```

### Update Existing Memories

If a session **confirms** an existing memory works, update it:

```javascript
await mcp__memory__add_observations({
  observations: [
    {
      entityName: "{existing-entity-name}",
      contents: ["Applied in: {project} - {today's date} - HELPFUL"],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Cross-Link Related Memories (Karpathy Wiki Pattern)

After saving each new entity, find 3-5 **existing** memories that the new information touches and update them with back-references. This is the highest-value step — it turns isolated memories into a connected knowledge graph at ingest time, not just during periodic consolidation.

**For each newly created entity:**

1. **Search broadly** — use 2-3 keyword queries against Memory MCP to find related memories across different entity types:

```javascript
// Search by topic keywords (not just the entity name)
const topicResults = await mcp__memory__search_nodes({
  query: "{2-3 key topic words from the new entity}",
});

// Search by technology/project if applicable
const techResults = await mcp__memory__search_nodes({
  query: "{technology or project name from the entity}",
});
```

2. **Select 3-5 most relevant** — skip the new entity itself and any that are only superficially related. Prioritize:
   - Memories the new entity **contradicts** (update both with contradiction note)
   - Memories the new entity **extends** (add "See also" observation)
   - Memories the new entity **validates** (add "Confirmed by" observation)
   - Memories in a different type that share the same root cause or domain

3. **Update each related memory** with a back-reference observation:

```javascript
// For each related existing memory, add a cross-reference
await mcp__memory__add_observations({
  observations: [
    {
      entityName: "{existing-memory-name}",
      contents: [
        "Cross-ref: {new-entity-name} — {one-line why they're related} ({today's date})",
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

4. **Create bidirectional relations** in the graph:

```javascript
await mcp__memory__create_relations({
  relations: [
    // Forward: new → existing
    {
      from: "{new-entity-name}",
      relationType: "{relation}",
      to: "{existing-memory-name}",
    },
    // Reverse where meaningful (e.g., pattern prevents mistake)
    {
      from: "{existing-memory-name}",
      relationType: "{reverse-relation}",
      to: "{new-entity-name}",
    },
  ],
});
```

5. **Mark the new entity as cross-linked** so `/consolidate` Phase 3.4 skips it:

```javascript
await mcp__memory__add_observations({
  observations: [
    {
      entityName: "{new-entity-name}",
      contents: [`Cross-linked: ${today's date} — ${N} related memories updated`],
    },
  ],
});
```

**Relation type selection guide:**

| New entity type | Related entity type | Likely relation                               |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| mistake:        | pattern:            | `prevents` (pattern prevents mistake)         |
| pattern:        | mistake:            | `derived_from` (pattern derived from mistake) |
| tech-insight:   | tech-insight:       | `related_to` or `contradicts`                 |
| pattern:        | pattern:            | `generalizes` or `competes_with`              |
| architecture:   | tech-insight:       | `applies_to`                                  |
| any             | any (same topic)    | `co_occurs`                                   |

**Budget:** Max 5 related memories per new entity. Max 2 MCP search calls per entity. This keeps cross-linking fast (~5-10 seconds per entity) while still touching the most relevant neighbors.

**Nudge mode:** In nudge mode (Phase 0), limit to 2 related memories per entity to stay under the 30-second budget.

### Reindex search index

After all memory writes (creates, updates, new observations, cross-links) are complete, rebuild the FTS5 index so subsequent searches reflect the new entries:

```bash
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search --reindex
```

This is a fast operation (~1s) and ensures `/meditate`, `/consolidate`, and any other skill using `mem-search` will find the freshly written memories.

## Phase 5a: Next-Session Intent

Before generating the report, capture a **next-session intent** — a 1-2 sentence statement of what comes next. This serves two purposes:

1. **Anti-bad-compact:** If autocompact fires before the next session starts, the compact summary will include this direction context, preventing the "compact dropped what matters" failure mode
2. **Session continuity:** The next `/primer` run picks up where this session left off

### How to generate

```
Look at:
- What was just completed (git log, state files)
- What remains undone (TODO items, pending phases, open QA issues)
- What the user's last messages indicated they wanted next

Produce:
"Next session intent: {1-2 sentences describing what should happen next}"
```

### Where to save

Write the intent to `~/.claude-setup/memory/auto/.next-session-intent` (plain text, overwritten each time — not a memory entity, just a transient handoff note):

```
{date} | {intent statement}
```

This file is ephemeral — `/primer` reads it if present, then it gets overwritten by the next `/meditate` run.

### Nudge mode

In nudge mode (Phase 0), skip this phase — intent only matters at session end.

## Phase 5: Report

Output a concise summary:

```markdown
## Meditation Report

**Session:** {what was done}
**Duration context:** {skill used or manual work}

### Captured ({N} entities)

| Entity      | Type    | Score | Summary |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| pattern:xyz | pattern | 7     | ...     |
| mistake:abc | mistake | 6     | ...     |

### Updated ({N} existing)

| Entity                    | Update                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| tech-insight:supabase-rls | Applied in: Contably - HELPFUL |

### Cross-Linked ({N} existing memories updated)

| New Entity  | Related Memory Updated   | Relation   | Back-Ref Added |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| pattern:xyz | mistake:abc              | prevents   | yes            |
| pattern:xyz | tech-insight:related-lib | related_to | yes            |

### Skipped ({N} below threshold)

| Candidate | Score | Reason               |
| --------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| ...       | 3     | Too project-specific |

---

Next consolidation: run `/consolidate` when memory count > 200 or weekly.
```

## Phase 5b: Wiki Ingest

After generating the meditation report, ingest the captured learnings into the LLM Wiki so they compound beyond the Memory MCP graph.

### What gets ingested

Only entities that scored **>= 7** and have **cross-project applicability**. Low-scoring or project-specific findings stay in Memory MCP only — the wiki is for durable, generalizable knowledge.

### How it works

For each qualifying entity from Phase 4:

1. **Format as wiki-ready content:**

```markdown
# {Entity Name}

**Type:** {pattern | mistake | tech-insight | architecture}
**Discovered:** {date}
**Source:** {session context}

## Summary

{The actual learning — specific, actionable}

## Details

{Fix steps for mistakes, trigger conditions for patterns, rationale for architecture decisions}

## Related

{Cross-references to related wiki pages using [[link]] syntax}
```

2. **Ingest to VPS wiki** via SSH:

```bash
# Check if a page already exists for this topic
ssh root@100.77.51.51 "ls /opt/claudia/agents/claudia/wiki/pages/{entity-slug}.md 2>/dev/null"

# If exists: append new observations under a dated section
# If new: create the page
ssh root@100.77.51.51 "cat >> /opt/claudia/agents/claudia/wiki/pages/{entity-slug}.md << 'WIKIEOF'
{formatted content}
WIKIEOF"
```

3. **Update the wiki index:**

```bash
ssh root@100.77.51.51 "grep -q '{entity-slug}' /opt/claudia/agents/claudia/wiki/index.md || echo '- [{entity-name}](pages/{entity-slug}.md) — {one-line summary} [{tags}]' >> /opt/claudia/agents/claudia/wiki/index.md"
```

4. **Log the operation:**

```bash
ssh root@100.77.51.51 "echo '[{date}] meditate-ingest: {entity-name} (score: {score})' >> /opt/claudia/agents/claudia/wiki/log.md"
```

### Report addition

Add a wiki section to the Phase 5 report:

```markdown
### Wiki Ingested ({N} entities)

| Entity           | Score | Wiki Page    | Status   |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- |
| pattern:xyz      | 8     | pages/xyz.md | Created  |
| tech-insight:abc | 7     | pages/abc.md | Appended |
```

### Nudge mode: Skip wiki ingest

In nudge mode (Phase 0), always skip wiki ingest — it requires VPS SSH and is too heavyweight for periodic checks.

## Phase 6: Skill Auto-Generation (Hermes Pattern)

> After extracting memory entities, evaluate whether the session produced a **reusable workflow** that warrants a new skill stub. This creates the compounding effect: complex sessions auto-generate skills, which future sessions can invoke.

### Heuristic Trigger

Evaluate the session for skill-worthiness ONLY if at least 2 of these conditions are met:

| Condition                  | Signal                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5+ distinct tool calls     | Multi-step workflow that could be encoded as a procedure    |
| Error recovery occurred    | A failed approach was corrected — the fix is the skill      |
| User correction happened   | "No, do X instead" — the corrected approach is worth saving |
| Same pattern seen 2+ times | Repetition signals reusability                              |
| Session > 45 minutes       | Long sessions often contain extractable procedures          |

### Skill Stub Generation

When the heuristic triggers:

1. **Extract the procedure:** Identify the sequence of steps that solved the task
2. **Name it:** Generate a kebab-case name from the task description (e.g., `deploy-oci-staging`)
3. **MECE validation** (from GBrain skill-creator pattern):
   a. List all existing skills: `ls -1 ~/.claude-setup/skills/`
   b. Check trigger overlap: compare the new skill's trigger phrases against existing skill descriptions
   c. If overlap > 80% with an existing skill → **extend** that skill instead of creating a new one
   d. If partial overlap (30-80%) → add a `## See Also` section cross-referencing the related skill
   e. If no overlap → proceed with creation
4. **Dedup check:** Search existing skills via `~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "skill:{name}"` — skip if a similar skill exists
5. **Draft the stub** to `~/.claude-setup/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: {name}
description: "{one-line description} — auto-generated from session on {date}"
user-invocable: true
context: fork
model: sonnet
effort: medium
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Bash
  - Glob
  - Grep
---

# {Name} Skill

Auto-generated from session: {session context}

## Steps

{extracted procedure — numbered steps with commands}

## Notes

- Generated by `/meditate` Phase 6 on {date}
- Review and refine before relying on this skill
- Mark as verified after first successful manual use
```

6. **Update routing:** If the new skill is user-invocable, add it to `~/.claude-setup/rules/skill-first.md` routing table
7. **Log it** in the meditation report (Phase 5) under a new section:

```markdown
### Auto-Generated Skills ({N})

| Skill              | Path                                         | Confidence |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| deploy-oci-staging | ~/.claude/skills/deploy-oci-staging/SKILL.md | 0.75       |
```

### Nudge Mode: Skip Skill Generation

In nudge mode (Phase 0), always skip skill generation — it's too heavyweight for periodic checks.

## Integration with Other Skills

### Auto-trigger after /ship

The `/ship` skill can call `/meditate` at the end of its cycle. Add to ship's post-implementation phase:

```
After QA passes and code is committed, run /meditate to capture learnings.
```

### Auto-trigger after /cto swarm

The `/cto` swarm mode generates cross-concern findings. After the final report, `/meditate` captures the most generalizable insights.

### Standalone use

The user can run `/meditate` at any time to reflect on recent work. The skill adapts to whatever context is available (git log, state files, or just the conversation history).
