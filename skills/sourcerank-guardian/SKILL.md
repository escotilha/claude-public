# SourceRank Guardian - Pre-Deploy Safety Gate

Last line of defense before broken code reaches staging or production. This skill performs a comprehensive multi-layer analysis of the SourceRank AI codebase, Render infrastructure, and runtime environment to catch architectural problems that surface-level testing misses.

## Context

SourceRank AI is a brand visibility monitoring SaaS that tracks how brands appear across AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini). The stack:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router, React 18, next-intl i18n)
- **Backend:** Fastify (TypeScript, Node.js 20), plugin-based architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) + Drizzle ORM + raw Supabase client (mixed)
- **Queue:** BullMQ workers + Redis (ioredis)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (JWT) + API key auth (timing-safe, SHA-256 hashed)
- **Payments:** Stripe (token-based billing with webhooks)
- **Infrastructure:** Render (web, API, worker services), Supabase (DB + auth)
- **Monorepo:** Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (ci.yml, e2e.yml)

### Why This Skill Exists

A CTO review (2026-03-15) uncovered 2 critical and 4 high-severity issues that testing alone missed:

1. Admin endpoint timing attack (string `!==` instead of `timingSafeEqual`)
2. Broad `/admin/` URL-pattern auth bypass in Supabase auth plugin
3. Org metadata injection via user-writable `user_metadata.organization_id`
4. Hardcoded superadmin email
5. Unbounded `SELECT *` from ai_mentions for dashboard aggregation (DoS vector)
6. Framework CVEs (Next.js 14.2.35, Fastify 4.x)

This guardian catches these classes of problems before they reach production.

## Codebase Map

These are the key paths the guardian must analyze. Pass these to subagents to avoid wasteful file discovery.

### API Source

- `apps/api/src/routes/` — 29 route modules (brands/, monitoring/, tokens/, holdings/, organizations/, users/, alerts/, analytics/, billing/, cms/, competitive/, competitors/, content/, intelligence/, platform/, public/, readiness/, recommendations/, reports/, site-audit/, stream/, test-query/, visibility/, white-label/, agency/, authority/, ai/, backlog/)
- `apps/api/src/plugins/` — auth, CSRF, permissions, rate limiting, token metering, API versioning, public API auth
- `apps/api/src/services/` — 44 service files (api-key-service, cache-service, ai-influence-score, crisis-detector, etc.)
- `apps/api/src/utils/superadmin.ts` — superadmin check (env var or fallback)
- `apps/api/src/index.ts` — Fastify entry point, plugin registration

### Database

- `packages/database/src/` — Drizzle schema definitions
- `packages/database/drizzle/` — Drizzle config
- `packages/database/migrations/` — SQL migrations

### Frontend

- `apps/web/` — Next.js 14 app (App Router, React 18)
- `apps/web/src/app/` — page routes
- `apps/web/src/components/` — UI components

### Shared Packages

- `packages/types/` — shared TypeScript types
- `packages/utils/` — shared utilities

### Worker

- `apps/worker/src/` — BullMQ worker jobs (monitoring, scheduling)
- `apps/worker/src/jobs/` — individual job handlers
- `apps/worker/src/index.ts` — worker entry point

### Infrastructure

- `render.yaml` — Render blueprint (services, databases, env vars)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint, typecheck, security audit, unit tests, build
- `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — Playwright E2E tests

### Config

- `.env.example` — all required env vars
- `turbo.json` — Turborepo task graph
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — monorepo config

## Workflow

### Step 0: Identify Deploy Target

Ask the user (if not specified):

- Deploy target: staging or production?
- Is there a specific commit range to review, or review HEAD against the last deployed commit?

If the user says "just run it" or does not specify, default to:

- Target: production (Render auto-deploys on push)
- Range: last 5 commits on current branch

### Step 1: Diff-Aware Analysis (Layer 4 — runs first in orchestrator)

This runs in the orchestrator because it determines which files changed and informs the scope of Layers 1-3.

1. Run `git log --oneline -10` in `/Users/ps/code/Sourcerankai` to see recent commits
2. Run `git diff --name-only HEAD~5..HEAD` (or the specified range) to get changed files
3. Categorize changed files into risk buckets:

| Bucket             | Files Matching                                                                           | Risk     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| AUTH_CHANGED       | `*/plugins/supabase-auth.ts`, `*/plugins/permissions.ts`, `*/plugins/public-api-auth.ts` | CRITICAL |
| ADMIN_CHANGED      | `*/utils/superadmin.ts`, any route with `/admin/` path                                   | CRITICAL |
| API_KEY_CHANGED    | `*/services/api-key-service.ts`                                                          | CRITICAL |
| ROUTES_CHANGED     | `apps/api/src/routes/**/*.ts`                                                            | HIGH     |
| PLUGINS_CHANGED    | `apps/api/src/plugins/*.ts`                                                              | HIGH     |
| MIGRATIONS_CHANGED | `packages/database/migrations/*`                                                         | HIGH     |
| WORKER_CHANGED     | `apps/worker/**`                                                                         | MEDIUM   |
| ENV_CHANGED        | `.env*`, `render.yaml`                                                                   | HIGH     |
| CI_CHANGED         | `.github/workflows/*`                                                                    | MEDIUM   |
| FRONTEND_CHANGED   | `apps/web/**`                                                                            | LOW      |

4. Check if new route files were added that are NOT registered in the main server file (`apps/api/src/index.ts`)
5. Store the diff summary and risk buckets to pass to Layer 1-3 subagents

### Step 2: Launch Parallel Analysis (Layers 1, 2, 3)

Spawn three subagents in parallel using the Agent tool. Pass each the diff summary from Step 1 so they can prioritize changed files.

#### Subagent 1: Code-Level Review (Layer 1) — model: sonnet

Spawn prompt:

```
You are a code-level security and correctness reviewer for SourceRank AI, a brand visibility monitoring SaaS.
Working directory: /Users/ps/code/Sourcerankai

CHANGED FILES (focus review here):
{diff_summary_from_step_1}

Run ALL of the following checks. For each check, report PASS, FAIL, or WARN with specific file:line references.

CHECK 1 - AUTH BYPASS AUDIT:
- Read apps/api/src/plugins/supabase-auth.ts — list every URL pattern that skips auth
- Verify each skip pattern is narrowly scoped (exact path match, not broad .includes())
- Check that /admin/ routes have their own auth enforcement (x-admin-key with timingSafeEqual)
- Verify no new route modules were added that would match a skip pattern accidentally
- FAIL if: any broad pattern like .includes('/admin/') that could match unintended routes
- FAIL if: any admin endpoint uses direct string comparison (!==) instead of timingSafeEqual

CHECK 2 - TIMING-SAFE KEY COMPARISON:
- Grep all .ts files in apps/api/ for patterns: !== expectedKey, !== process.env, key !== , secret !==
- These indicate timing-unsafe string comparisons for secrets
- The correct pattern is crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(a), Buffer.from(b))
- Verify apps/api/src/services/api-key-service.ts uses timingSafeEqual (reference implementation)
- FAIL if: any secret/key comparison uses !== or === instead of timingSafeEqual

CHECK 3 - ORGANIZATION ISOLATION:
- Read apps/api/src/plugins/supabase-auth.ts — check how organizationId is resolved
- Verify organizationId NEVER comes from user_metadata (user-writable in Supabase)
- Verify organizationId comes from database lookup (dbUser.organizationId) or falls back to user.id
- Grep all route files for direct references to user_metadata — flag any that use it for authorization decisions
- FAIL if: organizationId derived from user_metadata
- WARN if: any route reads user_metadata for authorization purposes

CHECK 4 - SUPERADMIN SECURITY:
- Read apps/api/src/utils/superadmin.ts
- Verify SUPERADMIN_EMAIL is read from env var (process.env.SUPERADMIN_EMAIL), not hardcoded
- Check that isSuperAdmin uses case-insensitive comparison
- FAIL if: email is hardcoded without env var fallback
- WARN if: only a single superadmin is supported (no comma-separated list)

CHECK 5 - UNBOUNDED QUERIES:
- Grep all route files for .select('*') without .limit() — these fetch all rows
- Specifically check the brands dashboard endpoint for in-memory aggregation of ai_mentions
- Grep for patterns like: .from('ai_mentions').select('*').eq('brand_id' — without limit or pagination
- The correct pattern is either: column projection (.select('platform, sentiment')), count-only (.select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })), or bounded by date range
- FAIL if: any endpoint fetches unbounded SELECT * for aggregation purposes
- WARN if: SELECT * is used where column projection would suffice

CHECK 6 - SECRETS AUDIT:
- Grep the entire repo (excluding node_modules/, .git/, dist/) for patterns: sk-ant-, sk_live_, sk_test_, ghp_, gho_, AKIA, supabase_service_role_key\s*=\s*["'][^<], password\s*=\s*["'][^<]
- Check .gitignore — verify .env is listed
- Verify no .env files (not .env.example) are tracked in git: run `git ls-files '*.env' ':!*.example'`
- FAIL if: any hardcoded secrets found or .env files tracked in git

CHECK 7 - INPUT VALIDATION:
- Grep route files for request.body, request.params, request.query usage
- Verify each has a corresponding Zod schema validation (schema.parse or schema.safeParse)
- Check for any routes that use request.body directly without Zod validation
- WARN if: any route handler accesses request.body without schema validation

CHECK 8 - DEPENDENCY CVEs:
- Read apps/web/package.json — check next version (must be >= 14.2.36 or patched)
- Read apps/api/package.json — check fastify version (must be >= 5.7.2 or patched 4.x)
- Run: cd /Users/ps/code/Sourcerankai && pnpm audit --json 2>/dev/null | head -100
- FAIL if: known CVE versions detected (next < 14.2.36, fastify < 4.29.2)
- WARN if: pnpm audit reports any high/critical vulnerabilities

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each check, output exactly:
## CHECK N - NAME: PASS|FAIL|WARN
Findings: (specific file:line references)
Impact: (what could go wrong)
Fix: (recommended action)
```

#### Subagent 2: Infrastructure Review (Layer 2) — model: sonnet

- Verify COOKIE_SECRET is required in production (not optional/fallback)
- Verify the plugin does not fall back to a dev secret in production
- Verify CSRF is applied to state-changing routes (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- FAIL if: CSRF can run with a default/dev secret in production
- WARN if: random per-instance secret used (breaks across scaled instances)

CHECK 4 - RATE LIMITING:
- Read apps/api/src/plugins/rate-limit-public.ts and any rate limit config

Impact: (what could go wrong)
Fix: (recommended action)
```

#### Subagent 3: Runtime Validation (Layer 3) — model: haiku

Spawn prompt:

```
You are a runtime validator for SourceRank AI's production environment.
This is a lightweight smoke test layer — if the site is not reachable, report all checks as SKIP (not FAIL).

Run the following checks using Bash (curl commands). All checks should be non-destructive and read-only.

- FAIL if: returns 200 or triggers monitoring without auth

CHECK 4 - CORS HEADERS:
- Run: curl -s -I -H "Origin: https://evil.com" https://api.sourcerank.ai/health --max-time 10
- Check the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response
- PASS if: header is absent or does not echo back https://evil.com
- FAIL if: Access-Control-Allow-Origin is * or echoes back the evil origin

CHECK 5 - SECURITY HEADERS:
- Run: curl -s -I https://api.sourcerank.ai/health --max-time 10
- Check for presence of:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
  - X-DNS-Prefetch-Control
  - X-Download-Options
- PASS if: Helmet headers present (at least X-Content-Type-Options)
- WARN if: any expected header missing

CHECK 6 - TLS CERTIFICATE:

- Also: curl -sv https://app.sourcerank.ai 2>&1 | grep -E "SSL certificate|subject:|expire"
- Verify certificates are valid and not expiring within 14 days
- PASS if: valid certificates with >14 days remaining
- WARN if: certificate expires within 14 days

CHECK 7 - WEBHOOK ENDPOINT:
- Run: curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST https://api.sourcerank.ai/api/v1/webhooks/stripe -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' --max-time 10
- PASS if: returns 400 (bad payload) or 401 (Stripe signature validation fails) — NOT 200
- FAIL if: returns 200 (webhook processed without valid Stripe signature)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each check, output exactly:
## CHECK N - NAME: PASS|FAIL|WARN|SKIP
Findings: (raw curl output or summary)
```

### Step 3: Collect and Synthesize Results

After all three subagents complete:

1. Collect their reports
2. Build the consolidated guardian report

### Step 4: Generate Guardian Report

Output the final report in this format:

```markdown
# SourceRank Guardian Report

**Date:** {date}
**Target:** {staging|production}
**Commit range:** {range}
**Overall verdict:** DEPLOY APPROVED / DEPLOY BLOCKED

- If only **WARN** and **PASS**: output `DEPLOY APPROVED WITH WARNINGS`
- If all **PASS**: output `DEPLOY APPROVED`

Ask the user if they want to:

1. Proceed with deploy (if approved)
2. Fix the blocking issues first (if blocked)
3. Generate a fix plan for the warnings

## Known Issues (Pre-Seeded)

These are known issues from the 2026-03-15 CTO review. The guardian should check for them and note their current status:

1. **Admin timing attack (S3):** `apps/api/src/routes/monitoring/index.ts` used `!==` for admin key comparison instead of `timingSafeEqual`. Should be fixed — verify.

2. **Broad admin auth bypass (S4):** `apps/api/src/plugins/supabase-auth.ts` used `request.url.includes('/admin/')` to skip auth. Should be narrowed to specific endpoint — verify.

3. **Org metadata injection (S8):** `apps/api/src/plugins/supabase-auth.ts` used `user.user_metadata?.organization_id` for organizationId fallback. Should use `user.id` instead — verify.

4. **Hardcoded superadmin (S5):** `apps/api/src/utils/superadmin.ts` had `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL = 'admin@sourcerank.ai'` hardcoded. Should read from env var — verify.

5. **Unbounded mention fetch (S6):** Dashboard endpoint at `apps/api/src/routes/brands/index.ts` did `SELECT * FROM ai_mentions WHERE brand_id = ?` without limit for aggregation. Should use column projection and bounded queries — verify.

6. **Framework CVEs (S1, S2):** Next.js 14.2.35 (DoS via RSC) and Fastify ^4.25.0 (Content-Type bypass). Should be upgraded — verify current versions.

7. **CSRF secret fallback (S7):** `apps/api/src/plugins/csrf.ts` falls back to dev secret or random per-instance secret in production. Should refuse to start without configured COOKIE_SECRET.

8. **Worker uncaughtException (S9):** `apps/worker/src/index.ts` keeps process alive after uncaughtException. Should crash and let Render restart.

9. **Mixed DB access:** Some routes use Drizzle ORM, others use raw Supabase client. Inconsistency risk — track but don't block deploys.

## Invocation Examples

```
# Full guardian check before production deploy
/sourcerank-guardian

# Guardian check for staging
/sourcerank-guardian staging

# Guardian check focused on last 3 commits
/sourcerank-guardian production last 3 commits

# Quick guardian (skip runtime checks if site is down)
/sourcerank-guardian --skip-runtime
```
