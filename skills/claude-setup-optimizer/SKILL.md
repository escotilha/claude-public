# Claude Setup Optimizer

Automatically analyzes the Claude Code changelog and recommends improvements to your agents, skills, plugins, and configuration based on new features.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Gets Latest Changelog** - Uses the built-in `/release-notes` command or conversation context
2. **Analyzes Your Setup** - Reviews all your agents, skills, plugins, rules, and configuration
3. **Diffs Against Baseline** - Compares current state to `~/.claude-setup/SETUP-BASELINE.md` to detect drift
4. **Role-Based Gap Analysis** - Evaluates coverage for both Developer and M&A Analyst roles
5. **Identifies Opportunities** - Finds ways your setup could benefit from new Claude features
6. **Generates Health Report** - Structured report with health score, updates, gaps, action items
7. **Recommends Improvements** - Provides specific, actionable recommendations
8. **Implements Changes** - Optionally applies improvements automatically

## Paths

### Portable Path Variable

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `$HOME` in bash commands and `~/` in documentation to ensure portability across different machines/users.

**Define this variable at the start of any bash operations:**

```bash
SETUP="$HOME/.claude-setup"
```

**Source of Truth Structure:**

```
~/.claude-setup/
├── skills/       <- All skills (SKILL.md per directory)
├── agents/       <- All agents (.md files)
├── commands/     <- Slash commands (.md files)
├── rules/        <- Global instruction files (.md)
├── hooks/        <- Hook scripts (.sh)
├── memory/       <- Memory files (core-memory.json, etc.)
└── settings.json <- Settings (hooks, MCP servers, env vars)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always read from AND write to `~/.claude-setup` directly. Do NOT use symlink paths like `~/.claude/` - use the source path to ensure:

- Consistent behavior regardless of symlink state
- Changes persist correctly
- Syncs across all devices

### Background (FYI only)

Claude Code searches for skills/agents in multiple locations, but symlinks point everything to the setup dir:

- `~/.claude/skills` -> ~/.claude-setup/skills
- `~/.claude/agents` -> ~/.claude-setup/agents
- `~/.claude/commands` -> ~/.claude-setup/commands

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Changelog + Inventory Setup (ALL IN PARALLEL)

**Run changelog fetch AND setup inventory simultaneously** — they are independent. Use a single message with parallel tool calls.

#### 1a. Changelog

The release notes are available directly inside Claude Code via the `/release-notes` command. **Check if the user already ran `/release-notes` in this conversation** — if the release notes are already in context, skip fetching entirely and use them.

If the release notes are NOT already in context, get them via Bash:

```bash
# Get the last ~300 lines of release notes (most recent versions)
claude -p "/release-notes" 2>/dev/null | tail -300
```

If `claude -p` is unavailable, fall back to:

1. WebSearch for "Claude Code changelog site:docs.anthropic.com" or "Claude Code release notes 2026"
2. WebFetch on https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog (if it exists)

**Never fetch the full CHANGELOG.md from GitHub** — it exceeds token limits.

Extract: new tools, skill/agent format changes, MCP updates, config options, hook events, plugin features, breaking changes.

#### 1b. Setup Inventory (Bash — single command, no subagents)

**Do NOT spawn Explore/Agent subagents for inventory.** Use Bash to extract all frontmatter in one pass:

```bash
SETUP="$HOME/.claude-setup"

echo "=== SKILLS FRONTMATTER ==="
for f in "$SETUP"/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  echo "--- $(basename $(dirname "$f")) ---"
  sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p' "$f" 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
done

echo "=== AGENTS FRONTMATTER ==="
for f in "$SETUP"/agents/*.md "$SETUP"/agents/**/*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  echo "--- $(basename "$f") ---"
  sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p' "$f" 2>/dev/null
  echo ""
done

echo "=== COMMANDS ==="
ls "$SETUP/commands/" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== RULES ==="
ls "$SETUP/rules/" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== HOOKS ==="
ls "$SETUP/hooks/" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== PLUGINS ==="
claude plugin list 2>/dev/null || echo "(no plugin CLI available)"

echo "=== CONFIG (settings.json) ==="
cat "$SETUP/settings.json" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== MCP SERVERS ==="
cat "$SETUP/settings.json" 2>/dev/null | grep -A1 '"description"' | grep description || true
```

This single Bash call replaces 3 Explore subagents and runs in seconds instead of minutes.

**Launch 1a and 1b in parallel** (two Bash calls in the same message), then proceed to Step 2 with combined results.

### Step 2: Compare and Identify Opportunities

Cross-reference changelog features against your current setup:

**Feature Categories to Check:**

1. **New Tools**: Are there new tools you're not using that could benefit your workflows?
2. **Skill/Agent Frontmatter Updates**: New frontmatter fields or format changes?
3. **Agent Capabilities**: Isolation modes, team patterns, background agents, memory scopes?
4. **MCP Updates**: New MCP servers, protocol changes, OAuth improvements, tool search?
5. **Hooks**: New hook events, HTTP hooks, prompt-based hooks, agent-scoped hooks?
6. **Plugin System**: Overlap between custom skills and available plugins?
7. **Performance Optimizations**: Parallelization, caching, context efficiency?
8. **Security Features**: New permission patterns, sandbox changes, security best practices?
9. **Configuration Options**: New settings, model overrides, auto-memory directory?

**Analysis Checklist — Skills:**

For each skill, check:

- [ ] Uses latest skill format (SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter)
- [ ] Takes advantage of parallel tool calls where applicable
- [ ] Uses `Agent` tool (not deprecated `Task`) for spawning subagents
- [ ] No skill uses `Agent(..., resume=...)` — use `SendMessage({to: agentId})` to resume agents (v2.1.77)
- [ ] Uses appropriate model tier selection (haiku/sonnet/opus per model-tier-strategy)
- [ ] Has proper tool-annotations in frontmatter (destructiveHint, readOnlyHint, etc.)
- [ ] Follows current best practices for triggers/descriptions
- [ ] Uses YAML-style lists in `allowed-tools` (cleaner than inline arrays)
- [ ] Leverages `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for self-referencing paths where useful (resolved at runtime to the skill's absolute directory path)
- [ ] Leverages `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` where session tracking is needed (resolved at runtime to the current session UUID)
- [ ] Uses `context: fork` where appropriate (runs in sub-agent, protects main context)
- [ ] Uses `agent` field to specify agent type for execution where applicable
- [ ] Has `hooks` in frontmatter for skill-scoped lifecycle events where needed
- [ ] Uses `skills` frontmatter field to auto-load dependencies for subagents

**Analysis Checklist — Agents:**

For each agent, check:

- [ ] Has `memory` frontmatter field (`user`, `project`, or `local` scope) where persistent state is useful
- [ ] Has `background: true` if it should always run as a background task
- [ ] Has `isolation: worktree` if it modifies files that could conflict with main session
- [ ] Has `permissionMode` set appropriately (e.g., `bypassPermissions` for trusted automated agents)
- [ ] Has `disallowedTools` to explicitly block tools that shouldn't be available
- [ ] Has `hooks` in frontmatter for agent-scoped lifecycle events where needed
- [ ] Specifies `model` explicitly when not inheriting from parent is desired

**Analysis Checklist — Hooks:**

Check for adoption of newer hook events:

- [ ] `PermissionRequest` — auto-approve/deny tool permissions with custom logic
- [ ] `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` — lifecycle management for subagents
- [ ] `Setup` — repository setup/maintenance via `--init` or `--maintenance` flags
- [ ] `InstructionsLoaded` — fires when CLAUDE.md or rules files load into context
- [ ] `ConfigChange` — fires when config files change mid-session (audit/security)
- [ ] `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove` — custom VCS setup/teardown for worktree isolation
- [ ] `TeammateIdle` / `TaskCompleted` — multi-agent workflow coordination
- [ ] `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` — session lifecycle
- [ ] `PostCompact` — fires after context compaction completes; useful for re-injecting critical state in long-running skills (v2.1.76)
- [ ] `Elicitation` / `ElicitationResult` — intercept and override MCP server structured input requests; useful for browserless, firecrawl, and other MCP-heavy skills (v2.1.76)
- [ ] HTTP hooks (`type: http`) — POST to webhook URLs instead of shell commands
- [ ] Prompt-based stop hooks — model-evaluated conditions for stopping

**Analysis Checklist — Configuration:**

Check for newer settings:

- [ ] `autoMemoryDirectory` — custom directory for auto-memory storage
- [ ] `modelOverrides` — map model picker entries to custom provider model IDs
- [ ] `spinnerVerbs` / `spinnerTipsOverride` — customized spinner experience
- [ ] `plansDirectory` — custom location for plan files
- [ ] `language` — configure Claude's response language
- [ ] `attribution` — customize commit and PR bylines
- [ ] `sandbox.enableWeakerNetworkIsolation` — for Go programs behind MITM proxies
- [ ] `includeGitInstructions` — remove built-in git instructions from system prompt
- [ ] `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON` — disable scheduled cron jobs
- [ ] `CLAUDE_CODE_FILE_READ_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` — override file read token limit
- [ ] `worktree.sparsePaths` — configure sparse checkout for `claude --worktree` in large monorepos (v2.1.76)
- [ ] `allowRead` — sandbox setting to allow read access to specific paths (v2.1.77)
- [ ] Opus 4.6 now defaults to 64k output tokens (128k upper bound) — skills spawning Opus subagents for long-form generation benefit without extra config (v2.1.77)

**Analysis Checklist — Plugins:**

- [ ] Are any custom skills duplicated by available plugins?
- [ ] Are installed plugins up-to-date?
- [ ] Could any skills benefit from being distributed as plugins for team use?

### Step 2b: Skill Execution History Analysis

Check if `~/.claude-setup/memory/skill-executions.jsonl` exists. If it does, analyze it for drift signals:

```bash
# Summary: invocation counts, error rates per skill, last 30 days
LOGFILE="$HOME/.claude-setup/memory/skill-executions.jsonl"
if [ -f "$LOGFILE" ]; then
  CUTOFF=$(date -v-30d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)
  jq -r --arg cutoff "$CUTOFF" 'select(.date >= $cutoff)' "$LOGFILE" | \
    jq -s 'group_by(.skill) | map({
      skill: .[0].skill,
      invocations: length,
      errors: [.[] | select(.hadError)] | length,
      errorRate: (([.[] | select(.hadError)] | length) / length * 100 | floor),
      projects: [.[].project] | unique,
      lastUsed: (sort_by(.timestamp) | last | .timestamp)
    }) | sort_by(-.invocations)'
fi
```

**Drift Detection Signals:**

| Signal                  | Threshold                          | Action                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error rate > 30%        | Last 30 days                       | Flag skill for SKILL.md review — likely stale instructions |
| Zero invocations        | Last 60 days                       | Flag as potentially unused — consider archiving            |
| Single-project usage    | All invocations from one project   | Check if skill should be project-specific                  |
| High error + high usage | > 10 invocations with > 20% errors | **HIGH priority** — skill is actively used but degrading   |

For each flagged skill, include in the recommendations:

```markdown
## [Priority] Skill Drift: {skill-name}

**Signal:** {error rate / unused / single-project}
**Data:** {N} invocations, {M}% error rate, last used {date}
**Projects:** {list}

**Recommended Action:**
Review SKILL.md for stale instructions, outdated tool references, or missing error handling.
Check if recent codebase changes broke assumptions in the skill.

**Effort:** Low (review) / Medium (amend)
```

### Step 2c: Cross-Skill Synergy Analysis

After changelog-based analysis, scan all skills for **cross-skill improvement opportunities** — ways newer or existing skills can enhance other skills.

#### Process

1. **Identify "newer" skills** — skills added or significantly updated in the last 90 days (check git log on SKILL.md files):

```bash
SETUP="$HOME/.claude-setup"
# Skills modified in last 90 days
git -C "$SETUP" log --since="90 days ago" --name-only --pretty=format: -- "skills/*/SKILL.md" | sort -u | grep -v '^$'
```

2. **For each newer skill, check if it can improve existing skills.** Consider:
   - Can it be composed into another skill's workflow? (e.g., `/get-api-docs` before API implementation in `/ship`)
   - Does it replace a manual step in another skill? (e.g., `/pinchtab` replacing raw Chrome MCP calls)
   - Does it provide better tooling for a subtask? (e.g., `/firecrawl` replacing `WebFetch` for scraping)
   - Can it be added as a `skills` dependency in another skill's frontmatter?
   - Does it offer a pattern that other skills should adopt?

3. **Score each potential improvement (1-10):**

| Score | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3   | Minor convenience, not worth the integration effort                       |
| 4-5   | Moderate improvement, but adds complexity                                 |
| 6-7   | Clear improvement, worth noting but not urgent                            |
| 8-9   | Significant improvement — reduces tokens, time, or errors substantially   |
| 10    | Critical — the existing skill is broken or severely degraded without this |

**Scoring criteria:**

- **Token savings** — does it reduce context usage? (+2 if >30% reduction)
- **Reliability** — does it fix a known failure mode? (+2 if yes)
- **Speed** — does it parallelize or eliminate steps? (+1 per step eliminated)
- **Quality** — does it improve output quality? (+1 if measurably better)
- **Complexity cost** — does the integration add significant complexity? (-1 to -3)

4. **Auto-implement improvements scoring ≥ 8.** These are high-value, clear wins. Apply them directly following the same parallel agent pattern in Step 5.

5. **List improvements scoring < 8** in the report under a dedicated section:

```markdown
## Cross-Skill Synergy Opportunities (Not Auto-Applied)

| Existing Skill | Newer Skill   | Improvement                                       | Score | Notes                                        |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| /ship          | /get-api-docs | Auto-fetch API docs before implementation phase   | 6     | Adds a step but improves code quality        |
| /qa-cycle      | /pinchtab     | Replace Chrome MCP with PinchTab for page testing | 7     | 5-13x cheaper, but requires PinchTab running |
| ...            | ...           | ...                                               | ...   | ...                                          |
```

**Important:** Only evaluate genuine improvements. Do not force synergies where none exist. If no cross-skill improvements are found, skip this section entirely.

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create a structured report with:

**Priority Levels:**

- **HIGH**: Security improvements, breaking change migrations, significant efficiency gains
- **MEDIUM**: New feature adoption, best practice updates
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements, style updates

**Recommendation Format:**

```markdown
## [Priority] Recommendation Title

**Affected Items:** skill-name, agent-name, etc.

**Current State:**
Description of how it works now

**Recommended Change:**
What should be changed and why

**New Feature Reference:**
Version and feature name from changelog

**Implementation:**
Specific steps or code changes needed

**Effort:** Low/Medium/High
```

### Step 3b: Baseline Diff

Read `~/.claude-setup/SETUP-BASELINE.md` and diff against current state:

1. **Component drift** — new skills/agents/MCP servers added since last baseline? Any removed?
2. **Count changes** — skill count, agent count, MCP server count vs baseline numbers
3. **Role coverage changes** — has Developer or M&A Analyst coverage improved since last review?
4. **Gap closure** — have any previously identified gaps been addressed?

Update the baseline file's `Last verified` date and any changed counts/components after the review.

### Step 3c: Role-Based Gap Analysis

Evaluate setup coverage for each of the user's roles:

**Developer Role (Primary)**

- CI/CD pipeline completeness (verify → review → commit → push → PR → deploy)
- Testing coverage (unit, E2E, QA cycle, persona testing)
- Architecture/security review capabilities
- Research and planning tools
- Browser/scraping automation options
- Score: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**M&A Analyst Role (Secondary)**

- Due diligence research capabilities
- Financial modeling / spreadsheet automation
- Deal pipeline / CRM tracking
- Market data and comparable analysis
- Board/investor reporting
- Document generation (proposals, memos)
- Score: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

For each gap, assess:

- **Impact**: How much does this gap slow the user down? (1-5)
- **Feasibility**: Can Claude Code address this with a new skill/MCP? (1-5)
- **Priority**: Impact × Feasibility

Only recommend filling gaps with Impact × Feasibility ≥ 12.

### Step 4: Present Structured Health Report

Present findings using this template:

```markdown
# Setup Optimization Report — {date}

## Health Score: {1-10}/10

{One-line justification}

## Executive Summary

- **Components:** {N} skills, {N} agents, {N} MCP servers, {N} rules
- **Changes since last review:** {summary of drift from baseline}
- **Top 3 recommendations:** {brief list}

## Updates Available

| Component | Current State | Recommended Change | Priority |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |

## Role Coverage

| Role        | Coverage       | Change  | Key Gaps |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Developer   | {HIGH/MED/LOW} | {↑/→/↓} | {gaps}   |
| M&A Analyst | {HIGH/MED/LOW} | {↑/→/↓} | {gaps}   |

## Recommendations

### HIGH Priority

1. ...

### MEDIUM Priority

1. ...

### LOW Priority

1. ...

## Action Items

- [ ] Prioritized list

## Next Review

- {next scheduled date}
```

Then ask:

1. Auto-implement all HIGH priority changes
2. Show details for specific recommendations
3. Skip implementation (just review)

````

### Step 5: Implement Improvements with Parallel Agents

**IMPORTANT: `~/.claude-setup` is the source of truth.** All changes MUST be made directly in the setup path to ensure they sync across devices.

**CRITICAL: Use parallel agents to implement changes concurrently.** Group approved changes into independent work streams and launch them as parallel agents. This dramatically speeds up implementation.

#### 5a. Back up affected files first

```bash
SETUP="$HOME/.claude-setup"
BACKUP="$SETUP/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP"
cp <file> "$BACKUP/"
````

#### 5b. Group changes into independent work streams

Categorize approved changes into groups that can run in parallel without conflicts (no two agents should edit the same file):

- **Skills agent**: All SKILL.md frontmatter and body changes
- **Agents agent**: All agent .md file changes
- **Config agent**: settings.json, hooks, and other config changes
- **Filesystem agent**: Directory moves, file deletions, archive operations

If a group touches too many files, split further (e.g., separate M&A skills from dev skills).

#### 5c. Launch parallel agents

Use the Agent tool to launch multiple agents in a **single message** with multiple tool calls. Each agent gets a detailed prompt listing exactly which files to change and what to do. Use `model: "haiku"` for mechanical edits, `model: "sonnet"` for edits requiring judgment.

Example pattern:

```
# In a SINGLE message, launch all these Agent calls simultaneously:

Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku", name="skill-fixer", description="Fix skill frontmatter", prompt="Read and edit these SKILL.md files: [list]. For each: [specific changes]...", run_in_background=true)

Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku", name="agent-fixer", description="Update agent files", prompt="Read and edit these agent .md files: [list]. For each: [specific changes]...", run_in_background=true)

Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", name="config-fixer", description="Update config files", prompt="Read and edit settings.json: [specific changes]...", run_in_background=true)
```

**Resuming agents (v2.1.77+):**

The Agent tool does NOT accept a `resume` parameter. To continue a previously spawned agent, use `SendMessage`:

```
# Give the agent a name when spawning:
Agent(name="skill-fixer", ...)

# Later, send follow-up instructions:
SendMessage(to="skill-fixer", message="Also update the verify skill frontmatter...")
```

The agent resumes with its full context preserved. Each new `Agent()` call starts fresh — use `SendMessage` to continue existing agents instead.

**Rules for parallel agents:**

- Each agent prompt must be self-contained with ALL context needed (file paths, exact changes)
- No agent should edit a file that another agent is also editing
- Use `run_in_background=true` to launch them concurrently
- Wait for all agents to complete, then verify results
- If a change depends on another change, put them in the same agent or run sequentially
- Always set `name` on background agents so they can be addressed via `SendMessage` if needed

#### 5d. Verify all changes

After all agents complete, spot-check key files to confirm changes were applied correctly. Read the frontmatter of a few modified files to verify.

#### 5e. Git commit and push (automatic)

A `Stop` hook in this skill's frontmatter automatically commits and pushes all changes to the GitHub backup repo when the skill finishes. No manual git commands needed.

## Example Recommendations

### Example 1: New Frontmatter Feature

````markdown
## [MEDIUM] Add memory scope to persistent agents

**Affected Items:** qa-runner.md, research-tracker.md

**Current State:**
Agents have no `memory` field — they lose context between sessions

**Recommended Change:**
Add `memory: project` to agents that benefit from remembering past runs within the same project.

**New Feature Reference:**
v2.1.33 — Added `memory` frontmatter field support for agents

**Implementation:**
Add to agent frontmatter:

```yaml
memory: project
```

**Effort:** Low
````

### Example 2: Worktree Isolation

````markdown
## [HIGH] Enable worktree isolation for parallel-dev agents

**Affected Items:** parallel-dev skill agent spawning

**Current State:**
Feature agents run in manually-created worktrees

**Recommended Change:**
Use `isolation: worktree` on Agent tool calls to let Claude Code manage worktree lifecycle automatically, including cleanup.

**New Feature Reference:**
v2.1.49 — Subagents support `isolation: "worktree"` for working in a temporary git worktree

**Implementation:**
Update Agent spawning calls:

```
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", isolation="worktree", prompt="Implement feature X...")
```

**Effort:** Medium
````

### Example 3: HTTP Hook

````markdown
## [MEDIUM] Add HTTP hook for deployment notifications

**Affected Items:** settings.json hooks section

**Current State:**
No deployment notification hook configured

**Recommended Change:**
Use HTTP hooks to POST deployment status to a webhook URL when skills complete. HTTP hooks are simpler and more portable than shell command hooks.

**New Feature Reference:**
v2.1.63 — Added HTTP hooks support

**Implementation:**
Add to hooks section in settings.json:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://your-webhook.example.com/deploy",
            "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${WEBHOOK_TOKEN}" },
            "allowedEnvVars": ["WEBHOOK_TOKEN"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Effort:** Low
````

## Triggers

This skill activates on:

- "optimize my claude setup"
- "check claude code updates"
- "improve my agents"
- "sync with claude changelog"
- "what's new in claude code"
- "update my skills for new features"
- "/optimize-setup"

## Error Handling

### Changelog Not Available

If `/release-notes` output is not in context and `claude -p` fails:

1. **WebSearch** — Search for "Claude Code changelog" or "Claude Code new features 2026"
2. **Read with limits** — Use `Read` tool with `limit=500` on any local changelog file
3. **WebFetch** — Fetch the official docs changelog page

### Large File Errors

If you encounter "File content exceeds maximum allowed tokens":

1. Use `Read` tool with `limit` and `offset` parameters to paginate
2. Use Bash `tail -N` to get only recent entries
3. Never attempt to fetch the full CHANGELOG.md via WebFetch — it's too large

## Notes

- Always preserve existing functionality when making changes
- Create backups before modifying files
- Test changes before committing
- Some recommendations may require manual review
- Keep track of which changelog versions have been reviewed to avoid duplicate work
- All paths use `$HOME` variable for cross-machine compatibility
