# Research — URL & Image-to-Action Intelligence

Analyze any URL or image and turn it into actionable improvements for your Claude Code setup or projects.

## Paths

```bash
ICLOUD_SETUP="$HOME/.claude-setup"
```

All reads and writes go to the iCloud path directly. Never use symlink paths.

## Scope

This skill evaluates research **only** against three targets:

1. **Claude Code setup** — skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, memory, subagent patterns, model tiers, CLI features
2. **Contably** — Brazil accounting/tax compliance SaaS (`~/code/contably`, Next.js + Supabase)
3. **oxi** — Autonomous Claude Code orchestrator (`~/code/oxi`, https://github.com/escotilha/oxi). Python; turns a markdown roadmap into shipped PRs via `claude -p` workers in git worktrees, with critic review, budget caps, heartbeat reaper, and adapter-based project config.

Ignore relevance to any other project (AgentWave, OpenClaw, SourceRank, etc.). If content is unrelated to any of the three targets, report "No actionable recommendations" — do not invent recommendations for other projects.

## Active Projects

| Project  | Path            | Stack                | Key Needs                                                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contably | ~/code/contably | Next.js + Supabase   | Brazil accounting, tax compliance, financial data extraction                                                    |
| oxi      | ~/code/oxi      | Python, `claude -p`, git worktrees | Autonomous orchestration, critic models, budget/safety rails, adapter pattern, prompt-injection isolation, dispatch reliability |

### Claude Code Skill Map (for matching content to Claude Code setup)

- CLI features/hooks/settings → ~/.claude-setup configuration, hooks, rules
- MCP servers → new MCP integrations, tool discovery
- Subagent patterns → model tiers, Agent Teams, parallel execution
- Skills/agents → skill authoring, agent definitions, routing
- Memory/knowledge → auto-memory, mem-search, knowledge graph
- Cost optimization → model delegation, token efficiency, advisor strategy

## Claude Setup Skill Map (for matching content to existing skills)

- Web scraping/data → firecrawl, scrapling, mna-toolkit
- Code quality/architecture → cto, code-review-agent
- Testing/QA → fulltest-skill, test-and-fix, qa-cycle
- Product/UX → cpo-ai-skill, website-design

- GitHub/repos → cpr, review-changes
- Email/comms → agentmail
- Research → deep-research, firecrawl, scrapling
- Legal/compliance → legal-_, compliance-_

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract + Analyze

Do everything in a single pass — no separate inventory scan needed.

#### 1a. Detect Input Type

- **URL**: Starts with `http://`, `https://`, or is a recognizable domain
- **AV URL**: YouTube, Spotify episode, Apple Podcast, or URL ending in `.mp3`/`.mp4`/`.wav`/`.m4a`/`.webm` — route to `summarize` CLI
- **Image path**: Ends with `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`
- **Pasted image**: Already visible in conversation

If ambiguous, check if path exists on disk using Glob.

#### 1b. Extract Content

**URLs** — Try Firecrawl first, escalate through fallbacks:

```
mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape({
  url: "<url>",
  formats: ["markdown"],
  onlyMainContent: true
})
```

Fallback chain if Firecrawl fails (403, empty, credits exhausted, bot-detected):

```
1. Firecrawl (cloud, fast, structured extraction)
   ↓ if fails
2. Exa highlights (neural search, query-relevant excerpts only — use when researching a topic, not a specific URL)
   mcp__exa__get_contents({ ids: ["<url>"], highlights: true, maxCharacters: 2000 })
   ↓ if not applicable (specific URL, not topic)
3. Scrapling Fetcher (local HTTP, TLS fingerprint impersonation, free)
   mcp__ScraplingServer__fetch({ url: "<url>", headless: true })
   ↓ if blocked (403, captcha, empty)
4. Scrapling StealthyFetcher (Playwright stealth, Cloudflare bypass)
   mcp__ScraplingServer__stealthy_fetch({ url: "<url>", headless: true, block_webrtc: true })
   ↓ if still fails
5. WebFetch (last resort)
```

If URL is a tweet/social post, replace domain with `api.fxtwitter.com` and use WebFetch. Fall back to WebSearch if that fails.

**YouTube / Podcasts / Audio-Video URLs** — Route through `summarize` CLI for transcription + summary:

```bash
# Detect AV URLs: youtube.com, youtu.be, spotify.com/episode, podcasts.apple.com,
# or any URL ending in .mp3, .mp4, .wav, .m4a, .webm
summarize "<url>" --markdown 2>/dev/null
```

If `summarize` succeeds, use its markdown output as the content for Phase 1c (classify + score). Skip the Firecrawl chain entirely for AV content — it can't extract transcripts.

If `summarize` fails (not installed, unsupported URL, API error), fall back to:

1. WebSearch for "[video/podcast title] transcript"
2. Firecrawl on the page itself (may get description/comments but not transcript)

**GitHub repos** — Scrape repo page (description, stars, tech stack from package.json). Only fetch README separately if the repo page lacks sufficient detail.

**Tweets/X posts** — Replace domain with `api.fxtwitter.com`, fetch via WebFetch. Fall back to WebSearch if that fails. For X long-form article posts (Twitter Articles / Notes), also try `summarize "<url>"` as it uses xurl for full article extraction that fxtwitter may miss.

**Images** — Read with `Read` tool (multimodal). Extract visible text, tool names, URLs, code. Use WebSearch for context on identified tools/products.

**Doc sites** — Use firecrawl_map to discover pages, scrape key sections.

#### 1c. Classify + Score (inline, no agent needed)

Classify content type:

| Type                  | Indicators                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tool/API**          | MCP server, CLI tool, SDK, npm package, API docs |
| **Pattern/Technique** | Coding pattern, architecture, workflow           |
| **Product/Feature**   | Product launch, feature demo, UX pattern         |
| **Infrastructure**    | Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, DevOps            |

Score relevance 0-10 against four targets (Claude Code + Contably only — ignore all other projects):

1. **Claude Code setup** — Does it improve skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, memory, or subagent patterns? Use the Claude Code Skill Map to match.
2. **Existing skills** — Does it introduce a tool/pattern an existing skill could use? Use the Claude Setup Skill Map to match.
3. **New skill opportunity** — No existing skill covers this, it's reusable, aligns with our stack (TypeScript, Next.js, Supabase)?
4. **Contably** — Would Contably benefit directly (Brazil accounting, tax compliance, Next.js + Supabase improvements)?

If content is not relevant to any of these four, score it low and report "No actionable recommendations". Do not invent recommendations for projects outside this scope.

### Phase 2: Recommend + Act

#### 2a. Present Report

**Output format is a NUMBERED LIST, not a table.** Each recommendation gets its own numbered `#### N.` heading so the user can reference them as "1, 3" when choosing what to apply. Do not collapse recommendations into a markdown table — tables make it harder to pick items by number.

```markdown
## Research: [Title]

**Source:** [url or image path]
**Type:** [Tool/Pattern/Product/Infrastructure]

### Summary

[2-3 sentences]

### Claude Setup Recommendations

#### 1. [Improve Existing / Create New / Benefit Project] — Score: X/10

- **Target:** [skill name / "New skill: xyz" / project name]
- **What:** [specific change]
- **Why:** [concrete benefit]
- **Effort:** Low / Medium / High
- **Score:** X/10 — [one-line justification]

#### 2. [...] — Score: X/10

[...]

### Contably Recommendations

[Only include this section if Contably relevance score >= 3. Number continues from the last Claude Setup recommendation — if Claude Setup had 3 items, Contably starts at #### 4.]

#### 4. [Improve Feature / New Integration / Enhance Capability] — Score: X/10

- **Target:** [Contably area: accounting engine / tax compliance / data ingestion / UI / Supabase schema / etc.]
- **What:** [specific change]
- **Why:** [concrete benefit]
- **Effort:** Low / Medium / High
- **Score:** X/10 — [one-line justification]

> Score = (impact × 0.4) + (feasibility × 0.3) + (relevance × 0.3)
> where each factor is 1-10. Impact: how much it improves the target.
> Feasibility: how easy to implement. Relevance: how aligned with current priorities.

### Memory

[Only if max relevance score >= 5: insight worth saving]
```

**Rules for numbering:**
- Number sequentially across sections (1, 2, 3, 4...) — do NOT restart numbering per section
- Sort recommendations by score descending within the full list
- Every recommendation is its own `#### N.` heading with bullets beneath — never a table row
- Minimum one recommendation per section that applies; if neither target has any, report "No actionable recommendations"

#### 2b. Ask User What to Apply

Use `AskUserQuestion` with recommendations as options. Each option label MUST include the score (e.g., "8/10 — Update /cto with new pattern"). Sort options by score descending. Include "Just save to memory" and "Skip".

#### 2c. Queue for Wiki Harvest (Memex)

After presenting the report, **always** queue the researched URL for wiki auto-ingest so it becomes part of the persistent knowledge base:

```bash
QUEUE_FILE="$HOME/.claude-setup/data/wiki-harvest-queue.json"
URL="<the researched URL>"
NOTE="<one-line summary from Phase 1c>"

# Create data dir and queue file if they don't exist
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude-setup/data"
[ -f "$QUEUE_FILE" ] || echo '[]' > "$QUEUE_FILE"

# Append URL if not already queued (jq dedup)
if ! jq -e --arg u "$URL" '.[] | select(.url == $u)' "$QUEUE_FILE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  jq --arg u "$URL" --arg n "$NOTE" --arg d "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
    '. + [{"url": $u, "note": $n, "addedAt": $d, "addedBy": "research-skill"}]' \
    "$QUEUE_FILE" > "${QUEUE_FILE}.tmp" && mv "${QUEUE_FILE}.tmp" "$QUEUE_FILE"
fi
```

This feeds into the wiki harvest which ingests queued URLs into the knowledge base.

#### 2d. Do NOT Auto-Install

Never automatically implement changes (skill edits, new skill creation, project modifications). Only present the recommendations and let the user decide what to do next. If the user explicitly asks you to implement a recommendation, then proceed.

**Save to memory only when max relevance score >= 5:**

First, dedup check — search for existing memories on the same topic:

```bash
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "<topic keywords>"
```

- If a **high-relevance match** is found (same URL, tool, or concept), **update the existing memory file** with new observations instead of creating a duplicate entity.
- If **no match**, proceed with creating a new memory:

```javascript
mcp__memory__create_entities({
  entities: [
    {
      name: "research-finding:<topic>",
      entityType: "research-finding",
      observations: [
        "Discovered: <date>",
        "Source: <url>",
        "Summary: <what it is>",
        "Applies to: <skills/projects>",
        "Action taken: <what was done>",
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

After writing any new or updated memory, reindex:

```bash
~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search --reindex
```

## Token Efficiency Notes

When researching a topic (not a specific URL):

- **Prefer Exa highlights** (`mcp__exa__search`) over Firecrawl search — returns only query-relevant passages (500-1,500 tokens vs 2,000-5,000)
- **Use Brave LLM Context** (`mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search`) for quick factual lookups with `count=5`
- **Avoid fetching full pages** unless the specific content is needed — highlights mode covers 80% of research needs

## Edge Cases

- **URL unreachable**: Try WebSearch for cached/discussed versions
- **Paywalled**: Extract what's available, supplement with WebSearch
- **Irrelevant content**: Report "No actionable recommendations" and offer to save as general reference
- **Already processed**: Run `~/.claude-setup/tools/mem-search "<url or topic>"` to check for existing `research-finding:` entities with same URL first
- **Image unreadable**: Report what's visible, ask user for context
