# Skill-First Rule

## Mandatory Pre-Flight Check

**BEFORE starting ANY task, scan the available skills list in the system reminder and check if a skill covers it.** Never do ad-hoc what a skill already handles. Skills use optimized pipelines, swarms, and established patterns — they are faster and more thorough than improvising.

When you identify a matching skill, tell the user which skill you're invoking and why, then call it via the Skill tool.

## When to Go Ad-Hoc

Only skip skills when:

1. The task is a **single small edit** (fix a typo, change a value)
2. The user explicitly asks for a specific manual approach
3. No skill covers the task at all
4. The task is pure conversation/explanation (no implementation)

> **Tip:** Run `claude agents` in the terminal to list all configured agents (specialist, project, and NuvinOS agents).

## Remote Monitoring (Remote Control)

Long-running skills like `/parallel-dev`, `/cto` (swarm), `/qa-cycle`, and `/fulltest-skill` can be monitored from any browser or mobile device using Claude Code Remote Control (Pro/Max, research preview).

- **From within a session:** type `/remote-control` or `/rc`
- **From CLI:** `claude remote-control` (supports `--verbose`, `--sandbox`, `--no-sandbox`)
- Uses outbound HTTPS polling only — no inbound ports needed
- Sessions reconnect automatically after network drops

Useful for fire-and-forget workflows: launch the skill locally, then monitor/approve from phone.

## Composing Skills

Many tasks benefit from chaining skills:

- Feature work: `/deep-plan` → `/ship` → `/verify` → `/cpr`
- QA cycle: `/qa-cycle` → `/qa-fix` → `/qa-verify`
- Release: `/review-changes` → `/verify` → `/cpr`
