# Skill-First Rule

## Mandatory Pre-Flight Check

**BEFORE starting ANY task, scan the available skills list in the system reminder and check if a skill covers it.** Never do ad-hoc what a skill already handles. Skills use optimized pipelines, swarms, and established patterns — they are faster and more thorough than improvising.

When you identify a matching skill, tell the user which skill you're invoking and why, then call it via the Skill tool.

## Routing Table

### Development Workflow

| Task                          | Skill                   | When                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build a feature end-to-end    | `/ship`                 | Feature requires spec → implement → test                 |
| Plan complex implementation   | `/deep-plan`            | Need research → plan → implement phases                  |

## When to Go Ad-Hoc

Only skip skills when:

1. The task is a **single small edit** (fix a typo, change a value)
2. The user explicitly asks for a specific manual approach
3. No skill covers the task at all
4. The task is pure conversation/explanation (no implementation)

> **Tip:** Run `claude agents` in the terminal to list all configured agents (specialist, project, and NuvinOS agents).

## Remote Monitoring (Remote Control)

Long-running skills like `/parallel-dev`, `/cto` (swarm), `/qa-cycle`, and `/fulltest-skill` can be monitored from any browser or mobile device using Claude Code Remote Control (Pro/Max/Team, v2.1.51+).

- **From within a session:** type `/remote-control` or `/rc` — attaches to current conversation with full history
- **From CLI:** `claude remote-control` — starts server mode (persistent, multi-session)
- **Interactive + remote:** `claude --remote-control` — normal interactive session with remote access enabled

### Server Mode Flags

| Flag                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--spawn worktree`           | Each concurrent remote session gets its own git worktree. **Recommended for `/parallel-dev` and `/qa-cycle`** — matches their existing worktree isolation model. Default: `same-dir`. Toggle at runtime with `w`. |
| `--capacity <N>`             | Max concurrent sessions (default: 32). Useful for `/fulltest-skill` with many parallel testers.                                                                                                                   |
| `--name "My Project"`        | Custom session title in the session list.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `--verbose`                  | Detailed connection/session logs.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--sandbox` / `--no-sandbox` | Filesystem/network isolation (off by default).                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Security Model

- Traffic routes through Anthropic API over TLS with short-lived scoped credentials
- No inbound ports opened — outbound HTTPS only
- Sessions reconnect automatically after network drops

### Access

Connect from another device via the session URL displayed in terminal, the QR code (press spacebar in server mode), or by finding the session in the claude.ai/code session list.

Useful for fire-and-forget workflows: launch the skill locally, then monitor/approve from phone.

## Composing Skills

Many tasks benefit from chaining skills:

- Feature work: `/deep-plan` → `/ship` → `/verify` → `/cpr`
- QA cycle: `/qa-cycle` → `/qa-fix` → `/qa-verify`
- Release: `/review-changes` → `/verify` → `/cpr`
