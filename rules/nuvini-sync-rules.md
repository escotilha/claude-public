# Nuvini Claude Repo Sync Rules

Rules for what to include/exclude when pushing to `escotilha/claude-public`.

## Purpose

The `escotilha/claude-public` repo is a **public-facing showcase** of reusable Claude Code skills and agents. It should contain only generic, portable skills — not project-specific, infrastructure-specific, or internal tooling.

## EXCLUDE from escotilha/claude-public

### Project-Specific Skills (tied to a single project)

- `qa-conta` — Contably-specific QA
- `qa-sourcerank` — SourceRank-specific QA
- `qa-stonegeo` — StoneGEO-specific QA
- `virtual-user-testing` — Contably-specific persona testing
- `verify-conta` — Contably-specific verification suite (ruff, mypy, tsc, vitest)
- `oci-health` — Contably OCI infrastructure health check
- `proposal-source` — SourceRank client proposals
- `chief-geo` — SourceRank GEO officer (daily autonomous)
- `health-report` — SourceRank-specific health report

### Deployment Skills (project-specific pipelines)

- `deploy-conta-staging` — Contably OCI staging deployment
- `deploy-conta-production` — Contably OCI production promotion
- `deploy-conta-full` — Contably staging → production pipeline
- `deploy-sourcerank` — SourceRank Render deployment
- `deploy-claudia` — Claudia VPS deployment
- `contably-guardian` — Contably pre-deploy checks
- `sourcerank-guardian` — SourceRank pre-deploy checks

### Internal Tooling (personal workflow, not reusable)

- `cs` — syncs escotilha/claude personal repo
- `cpr` — personal commit+push+PR shortcut
- `sc` — personal ship commit shortcut
- `paperclip` — Paperclip control plane (internal orchestration)
- `paperclip-create-agent` — Paperclip agent creation
- `slack` — personal Slack automation
- `agentmail` — personal email automation
- `tweet` — personal tweet fetching
- `gws` — personal Google Workspace automation
- `mini-remote` — SSH relay to Mac Mini
- `computer-use` — macOS/iOS desktop automation
- `nanoclaw` — personal agent runtime setup

### Personal Decision/Context Tools

- `pr-impact` — Nuvini (NVNI) press release optimizer
- `rex` — infrastructure security audit across personal machines
- `office-hours` — product office hours (internal brainstorming)
- `primer` — personal session context recovery
- `vibc` — advisory board deliberation simulator

### Infrastructure References (sensitive)

Never push content containing:

- Contabo VPS details (IPs, hostnames, SSH ports)
- Tailscale IPs or network topology
- Supabase project URLs or keys
- API endpoints for staging/production (e.g., api.contably.ai)
- Personal email addresses or agent mailboxes
- GitHub tokens or auth details

### Meta/Setup Skills

- `claude-setup-optimizer` — only useful for this specific setup
- `memory-consolidation` — tied to personal memory pipeline
- `meditate` — tied to personal memory pipeline
- `test-memory` — debug skill

### Generic Agents

All agents in `~/.claude-setup/agents/` are generic and safe to share.

## Decision Rule

**Before sharing a skill to escotilha/claude-public, ask:**

1. Does it reference a specific project name (Contably, SourceRank, StoneGEO)? -> EXCLUDE
2. Does it contain hardcoded IPs, URLs, or credentials? -> EXCLUDE
3. Does it only work with personal accounts/services (Slack, email, GitHub)? -> EXCLUDE
4. Could a stranger clone the repo and use this skill on their own project? -> INCLUDE
